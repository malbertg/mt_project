adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.", "Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded 'millennium bug' failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.", "You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.", "In the meantime, I should like to observe a minute' s silence, as a number of Members have requested, on behalf of all the victims concerned, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.", "Please rise, then, for this minute' s silence.", "(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)", "Madam President, on a point of order.", "You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka.", "One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam, who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago.", "Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?", "Yes, Mr Evans, I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.", "If the House agrees, I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested.", "Madam President, on a point of order.", "I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility.", "My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again.", "The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.", "It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.", "I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.", "I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report, not a legislative proposal, and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday.", "That is precisely the time when you may, if you wish, raise this question, i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.", "Madam President, coinciding with this year' s first part-session of the European Parliament, a date has been set, unfortunately for next Thursday, in Texas in America, for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death. We shall call him Mr Hicks.", "At the request of a French Member, Mr Zimeray, a petition has already been presented, which many people signed, including myself. However, I would ask you, in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community, to make representations, using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent, to the President and to the Governor of Texas, Mr Bush, who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.", "This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.", "Thank you, Mr Segni, I shall do so gladly.", "Indeed, it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted.", "Madam President, I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest.", "It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.", "All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia, too, access to environmental information is a constitutional right.", "Now, however, he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.", "We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.", "These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament's position, as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted, clear as far as Russia is concerned.", "Yes, Mrs Schroedter, I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter.", "Madam President, I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that, during this first part-session of the new year, the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.", "But, Madam President, my personal request has not been met.", "Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one, there is still no Dutch channel, which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.", "I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.", "Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors' meeting on Wednesday.", "It will, I hope, be examined in a positive light.", "Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes?", "Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected?", "Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998?", "Why has there been no fire drill, either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings?", "Why are there no fire instructions?", "Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?", "Why are no-smoking areas not enforced?", "It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.", "Mrs Lynne, you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done.", "I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors, and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.", "Madam President, Mrs D\u00edez Gonz\u00e1lez and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, which appeared in a Spanish newspaper.", "The competent services have not included them in the

Palacio' s intervention, on another occasion, and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.", "Mr Berenguer Fuster, we shall check all this.", "I admit that, at present, the matter seems to be somewhat confused.", "We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.", "Madam President, I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past?", "Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.", "So Parliament should send a message, since that is the wish of the vast majority.", "It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.", "As people have said, the situation there is extremely volatile.", "There is,

It did so again during this legislature, in July, and then, in September, it voted once more to approve the whole Commission.", "There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.", "To this end, I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.", "The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents, that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma. Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme, in which case it should clarify it.", "According to its President, it is in a position to do so.", "Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio, I believe that, before voting, it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme, as agreed. Alternatively, Parliament is not ready to examine this programme, as some appear to be suggesting.", "In my opinion, this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware, in writing, of a speech concerning the Commission' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier, as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so we could forego the debate, since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it.", "My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen, debate and reflect, there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that, if the Commission is ready to do so, we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.", "Therefore, the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and which you have mentioned, is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday, including its proposed administrative reform, because, otherwise, we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: on the pretext that there is no text, on the one hand, the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.", "Therefore, Madam President, I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.", "(Applause from the PSE Group)", "Madam President, I would like to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, amongst those, the decision establishing its agenda.", "We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide.", "But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate, as Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo has reminded us, which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission' s legislative programme, on the broad areas of action for the next five years, that is to say, for this legislature.", "Madam President, I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission' s legislative programme.", "I would also like to say that the Commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally, on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.", "Therefore, Madam President, I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and, when Parliament decides, - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for 2000, which is what we fully agreed upon.", "I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.", "(Parliament rejected the request) President.", "Still on the subject of Wednesday' s sitting, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.", "The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.", "Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this?", "Madam President, I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists.", "I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter.", "I do not know whether this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would, in any case, be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already.", "Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.", "That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.", "Thank you, Mr Poettering.", "We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request.", "Madam President, I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering' s lack of logic. He has just been preaching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents, and now he is doing just the same.", "We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups.

I did not see you asking to speak.", "Even so, I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes.", "When we adopt the Minutes for today' s sitting tomorrow, then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.", "This seems to me to be a workable solution.", "Of course, the Minutes for tomorrow' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.", "I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes.", "Mr Cox, Mr H\u00e4nsch, would this be acceptable to you?", "Madam President, if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not, and cannot, object to that.", "If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote, I accept that but with reservations.", "Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods", "The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)).", "Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.", "Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.", "Secondly, by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.", "Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.", "All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.", "Our amendments from the first reading have, I believe, been taken into account very satisfactorily.", "They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.", "The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive, is something which I would urge you to support.", "By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.", "I would urge you to endorse this.", "Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.", "As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as, I believe, we all do, of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.", "The renovation project, which lasted for months, cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe.", "The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit.", "In fact, all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.", "Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time.", "All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety.", "We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.", "Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.", "I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done.", "In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.", "Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has, at its heart, the issue of transport safety.", "The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway.", "I congratulate him on his excellent report.", "Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London, the terrible rail crash in Norway, the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.", "The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been retained.", "My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.", "When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.", "We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.", "Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.", "I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.", "We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements.", "This is a pity, in a sense.", "Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.", "This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.", "Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead.", "Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.", "Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.", "In short, the issue is an important one.", "If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.", "There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors.", "These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which causes problems.", "It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.", "The work is done. All that remains is the business of enforcement.", "I would like to mention one final point.", "With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months' time.", "This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.", "This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.", "Madam President, the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so.", "The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.", "Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.", "The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.", "I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations, although I would have preferred it if uniform, set standards and modules had been established, so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.", "This, however, does not seem feasible.", "Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can, therefore, give it my wholehearted support.", "Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which, though technical, are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.", "I should like to make just a few comments.", "Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea.", "Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long.", "This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.", "My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns the minimum standards.", "In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.", "However, when it comes to safety, I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden, for example, is in principle no different from safety in Germany, Italy or Austria.", "I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.", "Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.", "My third point has also been mentioned already. As you know, like Mr Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a particularly important role.", "We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.", "But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.", "Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.", "We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.", "The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.", "Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport.", "As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.", "The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.", "In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.", "In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.", "Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster.", "Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.", "Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.", "This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.", "But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.", "As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.", "I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.", "The debate is closed.", "The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.", "Transport of dangerous goods by road", "The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)].", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation.", "Delays in the CEN' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive.", "In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.", "I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.", "In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today.", "Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.", "The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.", "It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions which are no longer applicable, and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations, in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.", "The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity; the Member States obtain more powers.", "The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own.", "In so doing, it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.", "The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999.", "The proposal to be discussed today, to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road, dates from May 1999, however, and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.", "Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.", "We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months.", "In addition, the need for greater transparency has been pointed out.", "A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements, in particular for vacuum tanks, if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20\u00baC.", "This is in the special interest of northern European regions.", "A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.", "I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety, but I would ask you to endorse this report.", "Mr President, colleagues, a happy new year and millennium to you all.", "I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session, so this is quite exciting for me, a little like first love, although that did last longer than two minutes.", "I would like to briefly comment on the Commission' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.", "It is good that this directive should be established now, as, otherwise, Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time, a period of transition, which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy.", "The Commission' s proposal, however, does not take account of all the facts, such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions.", "Consequently, I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch' s intrinsically excellent report, which have been adopted by our committee.", "My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.", "According to the Commission' s proposal -20\u00baC would have been sufficient. On the shores of the Mediterranean, it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.", "There is support for the EU in Lapland also, so let us remember them.", "I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40\u00baC.", "This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.", "I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow' s vote.", "Mr President, with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.", "I thought that it was quite superb.", "On the subject at hand, I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe's roads, railways, and so on are as safe as possible.", "This directive is a contribution to this.", "What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.", "The rapporteur, Mr Koch, to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this, has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN, which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive.", "That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that, in 2001, we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.", "Mr President, the report we are discussing here does not, in itself, entail any major changes.", "Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.", "It is nonetheless worth emphasising that, each time we make this type of decision, it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market.", "Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU, both on roads and railways and by sea.", "This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind.", "In area after area, we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States.", "This is extraordinarily positive, and there is cause to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for the work he has put in on this issue.", "This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned.", "If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running, it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also, as far as possible, apply to every country.", "I should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance, namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament, Mr Ari Vatanen.", "In many ways, the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another.", "By approving this amendment, we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union.", "This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.", "It is good that, in establishing the present regulations, we can also be flexible.", "I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment.", "Mr President, I would like to thank not only Mr Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.", "The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously.", "I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations, and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts, in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.", "For one thing is clear: even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union, traffic does not stop at our borders, it goes beyond them.", "Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions.", "If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at?", "Mr President, I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report, which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport.", "We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has not been able, in the required time, to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union.", "This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours.", "A moment ago, Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures, not of 20 degrees below zero, but of 40 degrees below zero.", "Of course, we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union, which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.", "I would like to say, with regard to Mr Swoboda' s comments on the activity of the CEN, that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.", "Lastly, Mr President, the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out. We have referred to the delay by the CEN, the amendment of certain provisions, the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific.", "The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Koch, which are contained in the various amendments, specifically four.", "We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.", "The debate is closed.", "The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.", "Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination", "The next item is the report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds

make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament, namely Wales.", "A major part of Wales, as you know, has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme.", "It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face.", "We have seen poverty growing in Wales; and growing still further since 1997.", "We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.", "We are looking, therefore, within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality.", "What is, however, deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been, in a sense, a success of the government.", "It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces.", "That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront.", "We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.", "We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures.", "We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.", "We look to it to challenge the UK Government, to ensure that the private sector, which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure, is involved in the planning stage.", "Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.", "Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent.", "This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales.", "Mr President, our committee views these issues very differently and, to start, I will speak from the point of view of research.", "We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee' s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.", "This will be possible with action on the part of governments, and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.", "Another matter we would like to address, specifically from the point of view of industrial policy, is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services, electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet, when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds.", "Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.", "The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry, but today those areas might have become a burden, and they may well be poor, meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production, as I might call it, and the production of services, because they are the industries of the future.", "In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this, so on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would draw the Commission' s attention to this issue.", "Finally, as the committee representing energy, we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more, thus, through a process of coordination, increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.", "Mr President, I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague, Mrs Flautre, who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill.", "I would like to draw people's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.", "These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.", "In the past, this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.", "These amendments also fit in with this Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.", "We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.", "In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking, yet desperately needed.", "The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.", "But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted, as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme.", "It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance, which is subject to review after three and a half years, and the Member States' annual national plans for employment.", "We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.", "Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal presented by the Commission, in accordance with its mandate, is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.", "I would like to point out, however, that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us: maintaining a population in rural areas, given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.", "This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.", "The consequences do not inspire hope.", "It is the young people who are disappearing, who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas, all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.", "This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.", "We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union.", "Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union.", "Furthermore, three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes.", "For this reason, one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage conservation, the conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc. However, even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it is still essential, not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land, in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.", "Therefore, we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set. We want rural areas, at the dawn of the 21st century, to be competitive and multi-functional, both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.", "It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium, and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues, which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17.", "In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that, for the European Union, maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.", "Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter, the rapporteur, for her work.", "I think that this work has been carried out extremely well.", "I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.", "We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit, because at this stage, it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise, and nothing but hot air.", "The truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament, particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives.", "In our amendments, we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives, so that their application should be reflected, in the best and most profitable way, by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are, when all is said and done, the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.", "In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives, we think that those who generate employment, the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment, that is, businesspeople, must participate in this initiative.", "Small and medium-sized businesses, above all, need to take part in the distribution of these funds.", "If they do not, if businesspeople feel marginalised, if entrepreneurs cannot take part, not only in managing but also in receiving these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.", "Also, in order to attain our objectives, to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment, it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies, to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies.", "All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business, which, by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations, but complementing them, never obstructing or excluding them, will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.", "Mr President, it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague, Mr Evans, of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status. It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party.", "Let me also remind him that when his party leader, Mr Hague, was Secretary of State for Wales, he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements.", "I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality. I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation.", "My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today.", "I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines.", "The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration, to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine.", "It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector.", "It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future.", "The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about.", "They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape.", "They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development, resulting in inevitable delays and underspends, particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.", "The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer, either in the Commission or in the civil service.", "There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate, while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes.", "The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad, indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.", "If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence, which will be the key to future success.", "This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines: whether EU regional policy with a good, solid, enabling guideline, can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU.", "Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report. She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report.", "The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.", "We are badly behind now in this matter.", "Hopefully, the stands Parliament has taken will help, however, in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation.", "For the time, the report grew too large when it was being debated.", "It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports.", "At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy, bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality.", "Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes.", "It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes.", "Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas.", "We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes.", "Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes.", "Funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned.", "Projects have to be carried out more efficiently, more flexibly and they have to be made more productive.", "While the report was being prepared, it was interesting to discuss the Union' s regional policy in general.", "For us new members, it was the first time, and this was a very interesting process.", "This report is very good and our Group supports it.", "Mr President, Commissioner, as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution, the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group, Elisabeth Schroedter, has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission' s offices for several months.", "Bearing this in mind, this House should, in any event, demand that, before the Community support frameworks for the period in question are approved, they be studied and submitted for debate in this Parliament, specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today. This is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least-developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in European society and to the move towards a fairer Europe.", "Mr President, we should not forget that the main, strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion.", "We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.", "We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.", "We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.", "We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator.", "Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population.", "We will have to study several indicators, which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others, and how they are evolving.", "It is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament' s plenary sitting today that Europe' s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions.", "This fact means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically.", "I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity, as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives.", "I do not think, however, that this report has come too late.", "We need to consider it together, so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development, which have been drafted before the directives come into force, can be submitted for revision and proper assessment.", "We all agree that we should ask that, halfway through these programmes, when the assessment of the directives is made, Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens' representatives.", "Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is, at least on the face of it, bureaucratic.", "They need to see the political dimension working, to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.", "This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for.", "I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.", "Mr President, I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following: there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.", "This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent.", "Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.", "This latter point is of particular importance.", "While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers.", "We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone.", "The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries, mainly through the upgrading of roads, water treatment and related transport networks.", "This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year, which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session.", "Key EU programmes between 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe.", "The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date.", "This would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions, the poorer regions in Europe, are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone, as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital exist.", "In conclusion, while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society.", "The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions, financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment, assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy.", "Mr President, on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues. This time, however, I actually agree with her.", "Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path, I cannot say. Nevertheless, I would like to commend her on her work.", "The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex, as we and Mrs McCarthy, as rapporteurs for the general regulation, had asked.", "Unfortunately, this did not happen. Mr Berni\u00e9 is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee.", "I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament' s position.", "Thirdly, we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far.", "They are particularly beneficial to the Member States, and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development, job creation and, more particularly, on equal opportunities and transport issues.", "Personally, I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines.", "As an islander, however, I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development.", "This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves. This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, and I have raised the issue time and time again.", "Commissioner, we shall continue to raise the issue, as Article 158, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands. Therefore, the Commission should address the issue once and for all.", "The time has come to implement the programmes, and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly.", "As for us in Parliament, I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May.", "I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.", "Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work.", "Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy.", "To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds.", "For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States.", "For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.", "There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission' s attention.", "Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided. Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds.", "This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain.", "I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that the failure of the Commission' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and, especially, methods of combating unemployment among women and young people, is cause for serious concern.", "Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular.", "But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.", "The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability.", "That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide.", "I would like to explain our thinking here.", "Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.", "Past experience dictates that, as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer, we should, and indeed must, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money, hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as \"value for money\" indicators in the grant-giving process.", "Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period.", "But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.", "Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer, but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.", "Finally, we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.", "There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.", "Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see.", "That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.", "If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a \"hand-up\".", "I urge the House to support these changes.", "Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work.", "The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions. Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment.", "These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines.", "Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life.", "Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland.", "In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best.", "Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that.", "However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy.", "Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it.", "The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South.", "Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States.", "If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities.", "Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.", "The Union' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.", "A large section of the Union' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots.", "Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.", "Mr President, I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union.", "The first is the fundamental, central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion.", "We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously.", "We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union' s fundamental objectives.", "Secondly, I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention.", "In future, we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as, in my country, the islands of the Azores and Madeira.", "I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission' s report on the outermost regions, which has been long awaited by Parliament?", "Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.", "Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.", "However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.", "Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.", "I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.", "I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10, to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.", "I should be very grateful, Mrs Schroedter, if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.", "Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.", "Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion, despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how, in fact, these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe' s most highly-developed regions.", "They are growing, but only in terms of GDP.", "They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.", "Commissioner, please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority, because this is our citizens' greatest problem.", "Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require.", "Mr President, it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation, particularly for women and young people, and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.", "It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which, of course, comprise half of the islands of the Union, as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty.", "Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.", "The debate is closed.", "The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.", "Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union", "The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].", "Mr President, Commissioner, this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report.", "I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.", "The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions.", "In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.", "Finally, in my view, this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe, particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions.", "Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.", "Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Berend has just presented and congratulates the author, both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility, which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.", "It must be remembered that, currently, the European Union' s overall competitiveness is, in general terms, 81% of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units, that is the regions, also improves. Furthermore, this is at a time when technological development, economic globalisation and our problems, which are enlargement and the single currency, demand that the regions, as well as businesses and individuals, make more of an effort to be competitive.", "The European Commission' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions.", "I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur, one positive and one negative.", "The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major, although not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities.", "The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.", "It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation.", "This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period.", "Thus, Mr President, I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as other speakers have done, to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006.", "Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.", "The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union' s regional policy aims.", "The report shows that growth has been uneven, despite all our efforts.", "Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe.", "The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average, whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly.", "We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.", "Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences, long distances, climates that are too cold or too hot, sparse populations and austere conditions?", "How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development?", "It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union' s more remote areas.", "The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility.", "Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased.", "This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced.", "In the future, we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.", "For example, uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration.", "In this connection, too, weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development.", "It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how.", "Our Group is in favour of adopting this report.", "Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union' s regional policy has, until now, not been able to interpret, in any significant way, the existing differences in our inhabitants' incomes.", "We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today, there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty, as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached, on average, 23.7% in the regions worst affected, regions which also happen to be poor areas, whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment, corresponding to the richer areas, unemployment stands at just 4%.", "Given this situation, the report approved by Parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment: measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes, which are often misspent, with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems, with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the Trans-European rail Networks, which are due in 2007.", "There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries' agriculture and fisheries, which are often harmed by the European Union' s own insensitive policies, as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs, particularly for women and young people. Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.", "Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report.", "The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union.", "By stimulating a diversity of investments, the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment.", "From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.", "The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase, not really a satisfying result over a period during which, certainly over the past couple of years, there has been economic growth.", "As indicated by the rapporteur, the effects of the structural measures, on the other hand, are minimal as far as employment is concerned.", "Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for.", "Also, the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions.", "Mr President, it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities, especially in connection with boosting employment.", "It is, after all, they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit.", "By allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and, if necessary, tying this in with financial aid, a higher return can be achieved.", "Surely this must be the ultimate goal.", "I am therefore in favour of the Commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions.", "Following on from this, it is probably also more meaningful, with regard to the financial aid to regions, to give Member States more say anyway.", "By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States, we can avoid a great deal of problems later on.", "Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries.", "The report shows that, in general, they are a long way behind EU countries, especially in terms of GDP per capita.", "With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future, it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy.", "I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later.", "Mr President, Commissioner, following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part.", "For example, whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased, there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect.", "Equally, unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all, indeed they rose in some cases.", "I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently.", "Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries.", "Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment, then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.", "Genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base.", "If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term, then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.", "We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.", "Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report, because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.", "This issue, which has an impact on their everyday life, is a key issue as regards EU credibility.", "It has to be conceded that the EU has already aided, I would say quite magnificently, the development of poor countries.", "I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago.", "In this connection, French speakers would speak of a \"coup de chapeau\" : in other words, I take my hat off to the EU.", "The EU really deserves such a gesture, but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great.", "What is the result?", "People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.", "Consequently, we have to build schools, hospitals, and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over.", "This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems.", "Most people, however, would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised, if they were given the chance to, in other words, if there was work there.", "We must give them this opportunity.", "This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have.", "The solution, as I see it, lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship.", "By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business, but creating will.", "I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life, whether he or she is an employee, the owner of a business or an official.", "What is a fair society?", "One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children.", "In this way, positive development of the regions is also possible, because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance.", "Finally, I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America, where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy, as it often is here in Europe.", "Mr President, as all the previous speakers have done, I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report.", "Just like the previous report, this extremely competent and precise analysis, the recommendations it supports and your own comments, ladies and gentlemen, shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000-2006.", "I should also like to make a few comments, firstly, Mr Berend, regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report.", "You pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote, if I am not mistaken, that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports.", "On behalf of all the officials of the Commission and my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this House and by yourself.", "The Commission was certainly very anxious to ensure, Mr Berend, that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you.", "I am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2.1 of this report, where the Commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported, improved and influenced by factors which some of you - Mr Markov, just now, and Mrs Raschhofer - stressed very forcefully.", "I am thinking of technological research and development, infrastructure provision and quality, human resources potential, small and medium-sized businesses and direct investment from abroad.", "So much for the quality.", "I do not wish to spend time right now, Mr Berend, going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your House has already endorsed.", "Let me just itemise them: the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy, particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the Member States.", "Secondly, partnership, a subject which a number of you stressed, the role of local and regional authorities, the private sector, both sides of industry, associations and local community action groups.", "Regarding this problem of partnership, I shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the Structural Funds regulations are applied properly.", "Thirdly, the need to develop the employment side of growth, even though I am aware, as Mr van Dam just said, that the prime responsibility is that of the Member States, and that, when we speak of the responsibility of Member States, and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy, we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in.", "Mr Fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably.", "Mr Fruteau, we at least need to recognise that there is growth, and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession, as has been the case in the past.", "You will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike.", "I agree with your analysis.", "When there is growth, it must be better distributed, but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness, be they the most remote or island regions, is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades.", "Fourthly, a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stressed just now, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people.", "Fifthly, the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now.", "Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds, the motives of officials in managing these funds, even if it is occasionally complicated, and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation, follow-up and supervision of the Commission.", "In relation to this, I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of Structural Funds.", "I should like to mention a few specific points.", "Mr Berend, you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly.", "Well, we are coming to an end of the zoning phase.", "Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy' s turn.", "You may therefore be satisfied on this point, since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by Objective 2.", "Regarding the informal economy you mention in your report, I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and, as Mr Cocilovo mentioned, there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data.", "To a certain extent, they are taken into account in the statistics on GDP and labour force surveys and, in any case, I wish to point out the efforts which Eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics.", "Mr Berend, you also mentioned, as did Mr Aparicio S\u00e1nchez, the lack of reform in the fisheries sector.", "On this point which is of personal interest to me, let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context.", "This type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries, under Commissioner Fischler.", "Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns.", "Several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion, and your rapporteur mentioned some of these.", "I wish to assure you, firstly, that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is, as far as I am concerned, Mr Berend, an extremely important instrument, not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner, so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated, but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and, furthermore, with the elected representatives, i.e. yourselves, on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy.", "In any event, I have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report: the definition, compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe; a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned, particularly Mrs Sudre and Mr Fruteau; analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This will constitute a great challenge to us all, for you and for the Commission, in the next few years.", "And finally, there are the cross-border aspects. I shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points.", "Finally, I should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are, in any case, familiar with, but whose main elements I should like to reiterate.", "Ladies and gentlemen, considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence, particularly for the four cohesion countries, but also frankly, Mr Pohjamo, for the Objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development, especially regarding infrastructure.", "This is my first point regarding the policy.", "My second point regarding the policy is as follows: the Structural Funds have made, and continue to make, a significant contribution to the convergence process.", "All the macroeconomic models we are working on show that, over the last decade, more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the Structural Funds.", "I have, however, taken note, particularly with regard to the most remote regions, Mrs Sudre, Mr Fruteau, and Mr Nogueira Rom\u00e1n too, that your observation is that there is still much to do - and this is my third point regarding the policy - in terms of improving employment take-up aspects, the fight against social exclusion, which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions, and the integration of women and young people into the labour market.", "Now to my fourth point regarding the policy; enlargement of the Union, the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions, the major challenge, too, for the European policy on cohesion, a point which Mr van Dam highlighted.", "I shall say that something is already taking shape in Berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us.", "I am thinking in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument, which I shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks.", "You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the Union' s enlargement on our structural policy.", "This sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole, Mr Berend, is a good basis for our thinking, for us all and for myself.", "I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines, as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006.", "Thank you very much, Commissioner.", "The debate is closed.", "The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.", "(The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m.)", "Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting", "The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.", "Are there any comments?", "Mr President, I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes.", "I refer to item 11 on the order of business.", "Firstly, I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated.", "I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group.", "The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament, as other speakers remarked yesterday, can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission.", "We should also have the humility to recognise that, if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House, so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were.", "There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this.", "When there are major set-piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future, we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance.", "There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission.", "We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships.", "Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday, I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly.", "That is something for which I have a deep appreciation.", "I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.", "It should not be dramatised into something more than that.", "Thank you very much, Mr Cox.", "I understand what you are saying. We have taken note of this.", "Mr President, concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business, we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today's agenda.", "However, it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on.", "It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today's agenda.", "Mr Wynn, that makes sense.", "The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.", "Mr President, regarding Mrs Lynne's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building, I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower.", "This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong.", "I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly, but this is a serious problem.", "Mrs Ahern, we have taken note of this.", "I would ask you to bring this specific case, which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor, to the attention of the Quaestors, who are, in fact, responsible for the matter.", "We will also pass this on to our services, however.", "Thank you very much.", "(The Minutes were approved)", "Reform of European competition policy", "The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:", "A5-0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty [COM(1999) 101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)];", "A5-0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy 1998 [SEK(1999) 743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)];", "A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors. [COM(1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)] (Report 1995-1997);", "A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No. 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code). [COM(1999) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)].", "Mr President, Commissioner, today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union' s competition policy.", "We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau' s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe.", "I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term \"modernisation\" to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper, or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression \"retrograde step\" .", "However, we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998, and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter.", "But, of course, both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper.", "It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy.", "On reading both Commission documents, one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed, which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us.", "Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture.", "As the competent authority, the Commission, with its logically consistent approach, has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition, not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned.", "It should continue along this path.", "But, Commissioner, none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union, the deepening of the internal market, technological progress, globalisation.", "Indeed, it is not just about modernisation of Community law, more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases, about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions, for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population' s acceptance, together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned.", "Only, without transparency there will be no acceptance, indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.", "The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but, in fact, there is nothing that could not be further improved upon.", "Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought, Commissioner, but there is one point that I would just like to go into now. Transparency and accountability belong together.", "I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question.", "The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role, for the sake of its own independence; but Parliament is a supervisory body, and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one' s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament, indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion?", "Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen, strengthening and intensifying it.", "There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though. Parliament is a legislative body, but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law, of all things, is truly scandalous.", "Therefore, I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area.", "I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases, even given the Treaty status quo.", "I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures.", "This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions.", "With all due respect for the principle of competition, competition is not, however, an end in itself.", "Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions.", "At the end of the day, one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue.", "Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts.", "But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord.", "Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses, monopolies law being one example.", "But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation.", "Competition yes, restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible.", "However, since state aid forms the lion' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like, regardless of Mr Jonckheer' s report, to say one more thing about it.", "It is certainly possible, indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy.", "Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes, provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition.", "This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible.", "It is not just that we should pillory state aid; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives.", "My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party.", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties.", "The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors, according to various typologies, such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued.", "Let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid, on average, for the period under review, is in the order of EUR 95 billion, corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993-1995, a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany.", "To put it plainly, the level of state aid declared, roughly speaking, is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2% of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent, coincidentally, of the Community budget for one year.", "This being the case, there are considerable disparities between states, which may be measured in various ways, such as, for example, as a percentage of added value and per wage earner.", "I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid, which may be assimilated in some way into state aid.", "This clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund, among other things, which come at the top of the list.", "This being the case, let me now come to the proposals made in the report.", "We note, first of all, that the committee considers the data, as presented in the Commission' s annual report, to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate, sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition, pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty.", "The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States.", "It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided, and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect.", "It is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example, has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid, accessible via the Internet.", "Having better, more detailed information available, particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded, must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies.", "And insofar as such studies already exist, to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties, which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy, but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.", "By stressing, primarily, the quality of the information provided, our debate in committee, and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you, avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was, in absolute terms, either too high or not high enough.", "Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between, on the one hand, the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and, on the other hand, acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty, particularly, as I have said already, as regards sustainable development, research and development and economic and social cohesion.", "This being the case, various amendments to the rapporteur' s initial draft report were adopted in committee, particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results.", "Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting.", "Most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid, in view of the inadequacies, acknowledged or not, of private investment alone, the market failures or inadequacies of the market.", "There is in particular one amendment, let me point out, concerning the energy sector, which, in my capacity as rapporteur, I see as particularly important.", "I should like to conclude this presentation, Commissioner, by stressing two things: firstly, a concern of the members of the committee and, secondly, a demand of our committee.", "The concern involves the pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in terms of competition policy and state aid.", "This is undoubtedly a complex issue, and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter, particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and, as far as state aid is concerned, the need, in all probability, to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors.", "And finally, in conclusion, our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing, competition policy and state aid, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.", "As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid.", "Mr President, Commissioner, my contribution to today' s debate concerns the steel aid code, that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission.", "There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these.", "The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly.", "Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future. The European Commission' s decisions, which feature in the report, are welcomed by the European Parliament, as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases, thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty.", "The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament.", "As in other sectors, the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry.", "According to this article, state aid is irreconcilable with the common market, in principle.", "Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases.", "Under Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid.", "In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany.", "Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid.", "The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996.", "These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular, precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether.", "In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece.", "However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report.", "As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired.", "There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code.", "No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe.", "This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years.", "Consequently, Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry' s claims about unequal treatment, and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations.", "We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind.", "The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires, they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission' s supervision.", "We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires, steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94, for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity.", "This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code.", "A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments.", "What we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets.", "We also need to criticise the Commission' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view, do not fall within the categories of the code, even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned.", "The Commission will be called upon, in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999, to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions, thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made.", "Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions, I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity, which we have ourselves created, in plenary sitting.", "Mr President, as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today, even though there has been a delay.", "I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau, Mr Langen, Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer, as well as the Commission, for their excellent cooperation.", "Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story; take the energy and telecommunications sectors, where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service.", "All this is to the good of the consumer.", "But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further.", "The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points: dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement.", "Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs, at any rate.", "At the same time, this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world, of course.", "It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves, and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters.", "However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape.", "The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement.", "If we are to create a culture of law in Europe, then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission, by central bodies, but also by national authorities, by national courts.", "We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally, it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty.", "It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter.", "The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear, something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion.", "But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy.", "Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted, then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined.", "However, when it comes to what the future holds for competition, there are two issues dear to my heart.", "One is subsidiarity.", "We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency, and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions.", "Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union.", "I would cite, by way of example, the issue of job creation schemes, savings banks and regional banks, and G\u00fctesiegel.", "Here, a region has, by its own efforts, created a means of marketing its own products.", "This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention.", "I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation.", "We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other.", "My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy, although I am not going to talk about market failure just now.", "I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector, but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters.", "These days, someone who lives in an old people' s home is accommodated within the social field.", "However, I could also regard them as a customer, and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field, that is evolved structures, stifle competition.", "Apart from that, I could refer to any customers, any sector, as customers, and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields.", "To conclude, I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity. I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes, they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe.", "Thank you very much, Mr Radwan.", "I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliamentary-speak, inappropriately in your case, as a maiden speech.", "Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member, Robert Goebbels, who is unable to attend due to a political commitment.", "Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market.", "A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures.", "Even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market, it would not make any difference to the real world.", "Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources.", "While, since the dawn of time, the market has been the key forum for human interchange, it has never been perfect.", "The market favours the short term and immediate profits.", "On the market, the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties, consumers and workers.", "In order to function, the market needs rules.", "The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society.", "We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose.", "The market is not an end in itself; it must help to improve the human condition.", "The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators, but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion.", "Finally, aid can enable restructuring, offer training, save jobs and thus know-how.", "The main objective of the Union' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid.", "This aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union, particularly economic and social cohesion, sustainable development and research.", "The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market.", "It would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid.", "The Internet is not a product of the market, but the result of research financed by the American army.", "The World Wide Web, which has enabled the meteoric development of the information society, was developed by CERN in Geneva, once again with public aid.", "The German Government' s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy.", "President Duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness, the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism.", "I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the hedge fund, LTCM.", "Wishing to save 60 000 jobs is, apparently, a sin against the market, but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market.", "Public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation, as was the case in Mexico, Asia and Brazil.", "Human labour, on the other hand, is considered to be a simple factor in the equation.", "We Socialists reject the liberals' na\u00efve optimism on this point.", "We want a true culture of competition in Europe.", "The state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge.", "Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation.", "I want to thank you, Commissioner Monti, for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that, as we enter the new millennium, you have an especially important role.", "It is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments. These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy, but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless.", "Let me mention the latest examples we have seen: Holzmann, a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government; sawmills in former East Germany; and, especially, aid to shipyards.", "These are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets.", "I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and, to that extent, are helping to undermine the value of the euro.", "The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee, all concerning state aid.", "These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness, which is very important with a view to making the internal market work.", "I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.", "As I say, our amendments concern transparency, and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful, specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be.", "Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful.", "How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back?", "At present, there are no common rules in this area, and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment.", "This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition.", "Finally, we propose keeping both a register, as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs, and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid.", "You have shown us the way, Mr Monti, with the single market scoreboard.", "It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid.", "I very much hope that you, Commissioner Monti, will support these amendments, and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter.", "To conclude, I want to welcome the Commission' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy, on which, once again, a good deal of work has been done.", "But, as I have already mentioned, our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness.", "There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid.", "This is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who, in his report, has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria, as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition.", "As Liberals and Greens, we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look, but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives, and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems.", "Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answered.", "Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy, and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy?", "Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid.", "It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements.", "So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified.", "The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level.", "We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything.", "We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact.", "Mr President, once again we are debating the European Union' s competition policy.", "But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us.", "The overriding features of today' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational groups.", "Should we not be discussing this issue?", "We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies.", "Certain sectors of European industry, such as the shipbuilding industry, air transport and the steel industry, which have been hard hit by existing competition policy, have suffered tremendously.", "They have lost their status, and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant.", "When will we debate that?", "The scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states, and Member States of the Union at that.", "And yet, we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid.", "At the same time, unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.", "Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights.", "Consumers see their standard of living being eroded, poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition, in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business.", "We consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it.", "Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of this pivotal year, prior to the changeover to the single currency, the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment.", "The competition policy has, as far as these resources permitted, contributed to this event.", "For our part, we remain staunchly opposed to the single currency which, far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency, imprisons us in an artificial straitjacket, which has been imposed on the peoples of Europe.", "Having said that, governing means planning. It also means being responsible and, in this new context which has been forced upon us, competition law naturally has an essential role to play.", "In this area, the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action: acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-competitive practices, by refocusing its departments' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest Community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law.", "As regards state aid, it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex, and the introduction of a public register, where all aid would be recorded, does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints.", "Finally, on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction.", "The Commission is, in fact, retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities, but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all.", "National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control.", "In conclusion, I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction, we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which, if it were realised, would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states.", "Mr President, Commissioner, we have a basically positive view of the Commission' s White Paper on competition, particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation, but we are also puzzled by several things.", "First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes.", "In this respect, we should heed the words of von Eieck, and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni, who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies.", "State interference in the economy is, even today, still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market, competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers.", "There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this, there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann.", "Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option.", "Commissioner, I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties, but I believe that, it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy, especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition.", "What is being done may well be very important, but it is still not sufficient.", "Mr President, we are holding a special debate: on competition policy and state aid, the government' s right and left hand, so to speak.", "Whilst the EMU criteria are forcing Member States to curb expenditure, the high level of state aid to industry has so far remained in place.", "This is understandable, because it is highly likely that Member States which start to cut back on state aid will cause companies to leave, with adverse effects on employment.", "But, at the same time, this is not understandable because bad management and non-viable jobs should not be funded by taxpayers' money.", "In principle, only horizontal regulations are permissible because they do not distort, or hardly distort, competition.", "The rapporteur' s Amendments Nos 6 and 7, therefore, deserve our support.", "Amendments Nos 1 and 5 make reference to the phenomenon of market failure because the market instrument in itself does not result in the ideal society.", "Vulnerable people find themselves hardest hit.", "Market forces must be employed in a sophisticated manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizens and companies.", "If this comes to nothing, then the government has to step in.", "The Commission' s White Paper on modernising competition policy seems more like a discussion paper.", "The plea in favour of decentralisation in order to lighten the load within the Directorate-General on Competition is a kind gesture, but the way in which the Commission would like to carry this through would lead to the judiciary being stretched.", "This would be at the expense of legal certainty within industry.", "Does the pressure of work within the Commission really decrease when national judges are required to report to the Commission?", "What is the Council' s opinion on this and is the Commissioner prepared to completely reconsider these points?", "Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not something you can take or leave. It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that.", "It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense.", "I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views.", "I also assume that you, Commissioner, want to honour the reputation of, and the work put in by, your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective.", "I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner, but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless.", "Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application.", "In general, I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market.", "The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept, but also in terms of application.", "It is true, there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way.", "The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities.", "But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward.", "So, I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible.", "Secondly, I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty.", "Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern.", "This instrument will fall by the wayside in future.", "In the White Paper, you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines, but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next?", "Thirdly, I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy.", "I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection, as is already the case, one has got to admit, within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector.", "Fourthly, I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules.", "Fifthly, with the pending enlargement, I wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game.", "They are still in training, as it were.", "What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market?", "Sixthly and lastly, I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions, namely the legal privilege of company lawyers.", "If the Commission implements the White Paper objectives, it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable.", "Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege?", "Commissioner, I am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and I hope that, in this sense, we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit.", "Mr President, I would like, in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau.", "The fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure.", "We are, therefore, in agreement with the report, Commissioner, as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper.", "Since the Treaty entered into force, Community law on competition has been one of the tenets of Community policy.", "After almost forty years of being in force, these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion.", "For this reason, modernisation was essential.", "That modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons.", "Firstly, the authorisation system; secondly, decentralised application; thirdly, procedural rules; fourthly, judicial application; and fifthly and finally, excessive red tape.", "The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform, as was unanimously requested by specialised companies, academics and lawyers.", "I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system.", "A system, such as the current one, which is capable of making so few decisions, be they approvals or prohibitions, is something less than a valid system.", "National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81(1) and 82 for some time.", "However, they could not apply Article 81(3), which, to a certain extent, prevented the coherent application of Article 81(1).", "You will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice, both brought by German courts, which question the feasibility of applying 81(1) without being able to apply 81(3).", "A reform of this point was therefore also necessary.", "The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762.", "The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous.", "The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure, that it did not establish time limits, that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files, or that the right to defence was not properly recognised, were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform.", "The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994, the Commission published a communication on this subject.", "It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach.", "One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape.", "As a consequence of the continental legal tradition, consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market.", "It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis.", "The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals.", "It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report.", "Amongst these, firstly, is the fact that, despite trying to modernise Articles 81 and 82, Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight.", "At the moment, with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them, the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important.", "Secondly, Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation.", "For these reasons, we are going to vote in favour of the report.", "However, if some of the amendments are accepted, particularly those presented by the PPE-DE Group, we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document, lacking in rigour and, in that event, we would reconsider our support.", "Mr President, amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate, I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Berenguer, that is to say, the modernisation of competition policy, which is the subject of the Commission' s White Paper.", "Frankly, I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory.", "Through his management, Commissioner Monti achieves good results, as did his predecessor and, clearly, he has established a guarantee which, in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market, has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately, without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged, as has happened in the European Union since 1993.", "If it functions well, if we are satisfied, if the Commission has basically acted correctly, why the need for the modification?", "Various arguments have been presented in its favour.", "Mr Berenguer made a very accurate analysis, justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition, but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States, are truly identical in all regions.", "Because, if this is not the case, we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market.", "In that event we would not have moved forward, but rather backwards, in the application of competition policy in the Union.", "Mr President, I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union, when compared to previous reports.", "I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way.", "I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Country, which I represent - a margin for action, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity.", "Nevertheless, I cannot forget the numerous criticisms, both from Member States and from market operators, which, given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the Commission in its evaluation of specific cases, maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment, the planning of company mergers etc.", "The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval, through individual cases, which will take more than six or eight months to resolve, an excessively long period, which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility, affecting the generation of wealth and employment.", "I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations, lay down clear rules, which will benefit all of us: businesspeople, investors, workers and the citizens in general.", "Mr President, I would like to stress that, in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future.", "From the point of view of economic growth, and therefore of increasing employment and wealth, safeguarding a competition policy in the Member States is becoming a crucial factor, and one that is certainly very important for our future.", "This is why I give this report my full support.", "Recently, I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner, precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility, both for products and for services.", "I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future, for Europe' s economy, and, above all, for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general.", "Mr President, for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union.", "It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined.", "The truth is that the single market is not yet complete.", "During my six months as a Member of this Parliament, I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project.", "We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe.", "But all this, in effect, is so much rhetoric when we look at the national, regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market.", "That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission's proposals.", "I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti.", "We look to him as the man to root out cartels.", "But he would recognise that, as for everybody else, we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination.", "That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr von Wogau.", "I want to congratulate him, sadly in his absence, for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side!", "He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.", "So although I may not share his conclusions, I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address.", "The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy.", "I know that the Commission is set against this, but the potential exists.", "Resumption of the session", "I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 17 December, and I reiterate to you my wish that you have had a good holiday.", "As everyone has seen, the great \"effect of the year 2000\" has not occurred, but the citizens of several of our countries have been the victims of truly terrible natural disasters.", "You have asked for a debate on the subject in the coming days during this session.", "Waiting for this to happen, according to many colleagues who have asked me to do so, I ask that we do a minute of silence in memory of all the victims of the storms, in the different countries of the European Union concerned.", "I invite everyone to stand to observe a minute of silence.", "(Parliament rose and observed a minute's silence)", "Madam President, on a procedural point.", "You will know from the press and television that there have been a series of explosions and murders in Sri Lanka.", "One of the people who recently murdered in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam, who visited the European Parliament a few months ago.", "Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the President of Sri Lanka expressing Parliament's condolences on that and other violent deaths, asking him to do his utmost to find peaceful reconciliation in the face of the extremely difficult situation your country is experiencing?", "Yes, Mr Evans, I think that such an initiative as you have just suggested would be very appropriate.", "If the House agrees, I will do what Mr Evans has just suggested.", "Madam President, on a procedural point.", "I would like you to advise me on Article 143 concerning inadmissibility.", "My question concerns an issue that will be discussed on Thursday, the day I will raise it again.", "The Cunha report on multiannual management programmes is presented to Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 on a form of penalty payments based on quotas to be applied to countries that do not meet their fleet reduction targets annually.", "The report stipulated that it should be implemented despite the principle of relative stability.", "I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of Community fisheries policies, and therefore a proposal subverting it is legally inadmissible.", "I would like to know whether this type of objection can be made to what is only a report, not a legislative proposal, and whether it is something I can raise on Thursday.", "The honourable Member, if he so wishes, will be able to raise this issue at that time, i.e. on Thursday before the report is presented.", "Madam President, coinciding with this year's first part-session of the European Parliament, unfortunately, in the United States, in Texas, the execution of a death penalty, a 34-year-old young man named Hicks, has been set for next Thursday.", "At the request of a French Member, Mr Zimeray, a request has been made, the signatories of which have been numerous, and I am counting on them, however, in accordance with the position constantly expressed by the European Parliament and by the entire European Community, I ask you to intervene with the prestige of your office and the institution which you represent before the President and Governor of the State of Texas, Mr Bush, who has the power to suspend the sentence of death and pardon the sentenced person.", "All of this, in accordance with the principles we have always supported.", "Thank you, Mr Segni, I will do so very willingly.", "It is certainly within the line of positions that our Parliament has always taken.", "Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to a case that has been dealt with over and over again by this Parliament.", "This is the case of Alexander Nikitin.", "We all welcome here the fact that the court has declared him innocent and that it has shown that access to environmental information is also a constitutional right in Russia.", "However, it happens that he will be charged again, as the prosecutor will file an appeal.", "We know and have actually stated this in many resolutions - precisely at last plenary session last year - that this is not just a legal case and that it is a mistake to accuse Alexander Nikitin of criminal conduct and treason, because we, as affected by its results, are benefiting from it.", "These results form the basis of the European Barent Sea programmes and I therefore ask you to study a draft letter describing the most relevant facts and to make this position clear to Russia, which is in line with Parliament's decisions.", "Yes, Mrs Schroedter, I will gladly examine the facts relating to this subject as soon as I receive your letter.", "Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate you on having kept your promise, as indeed at this first session of the new year the number of channels in our offices has increased dramatically.", "However, Madam President, what I had asked for has not been done.", "It is true that there are now two Finnish and one Portuguese channels, but there are still no Dutch channels and I had asked for a Dutch channel, because the Dutch would also like to hear the news every month, when they send us into this exile.", "I would therefore like to ask you once again to ensure that we can also see a Dutch channel.", "Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this issue is on the agenda of the Quaestors' meeting set for Wednesday.", "I hope it will be examined in a positive spirit.", "Madam President, could you tell me why this Parliament does not comply with the health and safety legislation that it has actually adopted?", "Why hasn't any air quality tests been done on this building since we've been elected?", "Why has no meeting of the Health and Safety Committee been held since 1998?", "Why have we not had fire drills either in the buildings of the Brussels Parliament or in those of the Strasbourg Parliament?", "Why aren't there any instructions in case of a fire?", "Why haven't the stairs been improved since my accident?", "Why aren't non-smoking areas respected?", "It is totally shameful that we adopt legislation and do not comply with it ourselves.", "Mrs. Lynne, you're absolutely right in the world, and I'll check if these things haven't really been done.", "I will also submit the problem to the Quaestors' Board, and I am sure that the Quaestors will do their part to ensure that we respect the rules that we actually vote for ourselves.", "Mrs. President, Mrs. D\u00edez Gonz\u00e1lez and I myself had asked questions about certain views, reproduced in a Spanish newspaper, of the Vice-President, Ms. de Palacio.", "The competent services have not placed them on the agenda since they considered that they had already been answered at a previous session.", "I ask that this decision be reconsidered because this is not the case.", "The questions previously answered concerned Mrs de Palacio's intervention in a particular case, not those statements which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.", "Your Honor, let's check all this out.", "I confess that, for the time being, things seem somewhat confusing to me.", "Therefore, we will seriously review them so that everything is in order.", "Madam President, I would like to know whether Parliament will issue a clear statement this week on the dissatisfaction with today's decision not to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority of this Parliament in the past supported the arms embargo on Indonesia.", "Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous given the situation in that country.", "Parliament must therefore send a message, as that is the wish of the vast majority.", "It is irresponsible for EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.", "As people have said, the situation there is extremely precarious.", "In fact, there is a risk of a military coup in the future.", "We don't know what's going on there.", "Why should EU arms producers benefit at the expense of innocent people?", "In any case, this issue is not now one of the urgent demands for next Thursday.", "Order of business", "The next item is the final draft agenda, drawn up in accordance with Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure at the Conference of Presidents, on Thursday 13 January.", "With regard to Monday and Tuesday, there are no changes.", "Wednesday:", "The Group of the Party of European Socialists calls for the inclusion of a Commission statement on its strategic objectives for the next five years, as well as on the administrative reform of the Commission.", "I would like Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo, the author of the petition, to intervene to justify it, if he considers it appropriate, of course.", "As always, we will hear one speaker in favour and another against.", "Madam President, the presentation of the Prodi Commission's political programme for the entire legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which achieved the unanimity of the Conference of Presidents in September and also the explicit acceptance of President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment in his investiture speech.", "This commitment is important insofar as the Commission is a body that has the monopoly of the initiative under the Treaties and therefore basically shapes what the political and legislative activity of this Parliament will be in the next five years.", "I also remember, Madam President, that this Parliament voted twice in the previous legislature for its confidence in President Prodi; in this legislature it voted again in July and then, with the new Commission in place, again in September to give the whole Commission a vote of confidence.", "There has therefore already been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to know it and to explain it to the citizens.", "In this regard, I recall the resolution of 15 September, in which it was recommended that the proposal be submitted as soon as possible.", "The events that occurred last week - which have originated outside the Conference of Presidents and using it only to corroborate and ratify decisions taken outside it - present a dilemma: either the Commission is not in a position to present that agenda (in that case it would be useful to clarify it).", "In the words of its President, it is in a position to do so.", "Since the Commission is represented by the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, I think it would be useful to know the situation of the Commission in relation to its readiness to present the programme, as agreed; or Parliament is not in a position to examine this programme, as some seem to claim.", "In my opinion, this second hypothesis would mean abandoning our responsibilities as a Parliament, in addition to introducing an original thesis, an unknown method of making the political groups known in writing the Commission's programmatic discourse a week earlier - and not the day before, as had been agreed - given that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so that we could dispense with the debate, because the next day the press and the Internet would have made it known to all citizens and Parliament would no longer have to deal with the matter.", "As my group believes that a Parliament is prepared to listen, to debate and to reflect, we believe that there is no reason to justify this postponement and we believe that if, if the Commission is in a position to do so, we are perfectly in time to be able to restore the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and to proceed responsibly to our fellow citizens.", "Therefore, the proposal made by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and which the honourable Member has mentioned is that the presentation of the Prodi Commission's legislative programme should be maintained on Wednesday, including within this programme also the draft administrative reform because, if not, we can find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: with the excuse that there is no text, on the one hand the President of the Commission is denied the right to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, a debate on the reform takes place without this Parliament first knowing the texts on which it is based.", "I would therefore ask you, Madam President, to ask the Commission to make a statement at this stage and then to proceed to the vote.", "(Applause from the PSE Group)", "Madam President, I should like to make it very clear that, first and foremost, the Commission has the utmost respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, among them, to establish its agenda.", "We therefore respect what Parliament can decide in this regard.", "But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi committed himself to Parliament to incorporating a new debate, as Mr Bar\u00f3n recalled, which is added to the annual debate on the Commission's legislative programme, on the broad lines of action for the next five years, that is, for this legislature.", "I would like to say, Madam President, that this debate was distinguished, in the agreement reached in September, from what is the annual presentation of the Commission's legislative programme.", "And I would like to say, Madam President, that, on the part of the Commission, we are prepared and ready to have that debate when appropriate, that we were prepared to do so this week, as was agreed in principle, on the basis that it was presented the day before in a speech to the parliamentary groups.", "Therefore, Madam President, I would like to reiterate that, for our part, we have discussed the programme of action for the next five years and that we are prepared, when Parliament so decides, - this very week if that is the decision - to come forward with the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for the year 2000, which was what was perfectly agreed.", "I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists to reintroduce the Commission's statement on its strategic objectives.", "(Parliament rejected the request)", "On Wednesday's subject, I have another proposal concerning the oral question on capital tax.", "The PPE-DE Group calls for this item to be removed from the agenda.", "Will any of your colleagues take the floor on behalf of the group to justify this request?", "Madam President, I hear some laughter among the Socialists.", "I have been told that broad circles in the Socialist Group also welcome the deletion of this item from the agenda, because in the vote taken at the Conference of Presidents the vote of the working group responsible for this was lacking from our colleagues in the Socialist Group.", "I do not know whether this information is correct, but we, as the PPE/DE Group, would welcome the deletion of this point, as Parliament has already dealt with this issue many times before.", "There are also agreements against such a tax.", "My group therefore requests that this item of the day be deleted.", "Thank you, Mr Poettering.", "Let us now listen to Mr Wurtz, who will speak against the petition.", "Madam President, first of all I would like to underline the lack of logic of Mr Poettering, who has just taught the Group of European Socialists a lesson in order to return to a decision that was taken in an absolutely clear way in the Conference of Presidents.", "And he does the same thing.", "We have discussed, we have expressed unanimity, with the exception of the PPE groups and the European Liberal Democratic and Reformist Party, and I myself noted - as my fellow Presidents will recall - that it is not a question of knowing whether you are in favour of or against the Todin tax, but of knowing whether you dare to understand what the Commission and the Council think about it.", "It's not asking too much.", "I therefore reiterate the proposal to keep this oral question to the Commission and the Council in order to know once and for all what the position of these two bodies is with regard to this relatively modest proposal, but which would be an important signal for the opinion, especially after the shock that caused the failure of the Seattle Conference.", "We are voting on the PPE-DE Group's proposal to withdraw the oral question on capital tax from the agenda.", "(Parliament rejected the proposal by 164 votes to 166, with 7 abstentions)", "Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for the publicity he has just given to this debate.", "Thank you.", "Madam President, has my vote been counted, which could not be done electronically, because I do not have the card?", "My vote was \"in favour.\"", "Madam President, the Presidency has proclaimed the result of the vote.", "There are no changes.", "Madam President, in the previous vote - and I will stick to your decision on this matter - on the issue of the Commission's strategic plan, I indicated that I would have liked to speak before the vote on behalf of my group.", "This hasn't happened.", "I should be grateful if I could close this point by allowing myself to explain the vote on behalf of my group.", "It's an important matter.", "It would be useful for the House's record to record how people perceive what we have done in the light of their own political analyses.", "Madam President, I do not wish to resume the debate, but I also asked for the floor to give my opinion on Mr Bar\u00f3n Crespo's amendment.", "You haven't named me either.", "I am sorry, but the vote has been taken, the decision has been taken and so let it go.", "I am very sorry, Mr H\u00e4nsch, Mr Cox, I have not noticed that you were asking for the floor.", "In these circumstances, I believe that the positions are clear and will be reflected in the Minutes.", "When it comes to the adoption of the Minutes of today's sitting tomorrow, if you feel that the positions have not been explained well enough, you will be able to ask for amendments.", "I think it's a good formula.", "Of course, the Minutes of tomorrow's sitting will contain all the additional explanations.", "I believe that this formula is better than proceeding now to explanations of vote that would take us a long time.", "Mr. H\u00e4nsch, Mr. Cox, is that okay with you?", "Madam President, if the record of the vote correctly shows how my group voted, I do not want to raise any objection or objection.", "If your decision is that we cannot explain our vote, I will abide by it, but not without reservations.", "Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods", "The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0105/1999) on the Council common position on the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on minimum requirements for the examination of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)). (Commission on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism) (Rapporteur: Dieter-Lebrecht Koch).", "- (DE) Distinguished Commissioner, distinguished Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the Council's common position on the harmonization of the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.", "Firstly, we have had to act in the formal field to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC which obliges Member States to set up risk prevention officers for dangerous goods or safety advisers, as well as for the organisation, schooling and examination of such persons, without specifying this explicitly.", "Secondly: with this directive we aim to: (a) increase safety in both the transport and trans-shipment of dangerous goods; (b) reduce the distortions of competition that follow from the existence of very different national training and cost structures; and (c) establish equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.", "Thirdly, with the directive, as it is now presented as a common position and, in particular, as it is limited exclusively to minimum standards, we guarantee a high degree of flexibility and a low level of regulation by the European Union, thus contributing greatly to the self-responsibility of the Member States.", "All this must be celebrated in the sense of subsidiarity.", "I believe that our amendments at first reading have been satisfactorily taken into account.", "They have been accepted, properly implemented or not accepted because the corresponding European regulations were not accepted, e.g. a system of sanctions for cases of transgression or a complicated constitution of blocks of issues.", "I would ask you to agree to an amendment by the Committee on Regional Policy and Tourism, which has been adopted unanimously and which concerns the temporary implementation of the directive.", "To the extent that we do not impose on the Member States any date for the implementation of the directive, but rather grant them a period of three months from the date of entry into force of the directive, we introduce a flexibility clause which ensures that implementation is carried out without delay.", "I ask for your agreement.", "Madam President, we cannot and should not get used to hearing more and more news of accidents on the road, on the rail or on the waterways where there is great damage, not only, but also, because those affected do not take the transit of dangerous goods seriously enough or because very often, due to ignorance or poor preparation of drivers or others responsible for the various means of transport, a small accident has been followed by a major disaster.", "I as an Austrian, but I believe that we all still have a vivid memory of the catastrophe that last year cost the lives of many people in the Tauern tunnel and in which later it was necessary to rebuild for long months and with a huge financial expense that was destroyed by the fire in the tunnel.", "This refurbishment, which lasted several months, cut this important transport route between northern and southern Europe.", "The consequent diversion of transport for this reason has led to the limit of the tolerable to many thousands of EU citizens.", "There was indeed a chaotic situation in certain localities of my country.", "Prevention must be our response to such disasters, and with this draft directive we have established an important basis for the availability of well-trained risk-prevention officers so that the right thing can be done at the right time.", "Of course, we cannot be content with creating European law in the interests of greater security.", "We must also therefore ensure that our objectives are incorporated into national legislation by the Member States within the deadlines set and, more importantly, that they are then implemented.", "Please make sure that this is not another area in which we have to regret a deficit in implementation.", "I would like to refer to one last point: we must not be content to close another hole in the safety net and then close our eyes to the fact that there is still much more to be done on transport safety in Europe.", "In this regard, I would like to ask the Commissioner responsible, who is here, to present the relevant text as soon as possible in order to improve tunnel safety in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to suffer disasters of such dimensions.", "Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Koch for his report, which focused on the issue of transport safety.", "The report deals with the question of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisers who carry out their tasks in the field of the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail and waterways.", "I congratulate you on your excellent report.", "Unfortunately, transport safety has recently been news: the Paddington railway accident in London, that of Norway, the two air accidents involving EU citizens, and the natural disaster caused by the Erika in Brittany - all of which occurred in the last four months - remind us that we must never take safe transport for granted, and that those responsible for protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.", "The rapporteur pointed out to the House that the Council accepted in its common position six of the ten parliamentary amendments tabled at first reading, and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been taken into account.", "My group is therefore going to support this common position and hopes that legislation will be adopted that will provide us with another tool in our struggle to increase transport safety in the European Union as much as possible.", "When it comes to security, my group will always support initiatives that increase transport safety.", "As recent events have shown, we still have much to do on this issue.", "Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.", "Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his extremely precise and technical work in this report, and secondly, I would like to thank the Commission for the proposal that he has put forward.", "This is the harmonization of examination requirements, but we are actually talking about minimum requirements.", "It's a shame in a sense.", "The importance of road, rail and inland waterway transport safety is naturally very great and, given the international nature of transport, the training of safety advisers should be harmonised, as should the requirements of the future ADR, for example.", "That is important, but so is control, and there are of course several reasons why we should pay special attention to it.", "Look at road accidents in recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and some other countries where, in fog, trucks with dangerous goods were still on the road when they should have stopped at the time.", "Or ships coming from Eastern Europe docked next to other vessels where there is a more than obvious danger situation.", "Moreover, it follows from the investigations carried out at ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan that 50% of containers with partially dangerous goods are not delivered correctly.", "In other words, it is of great importance.", "Looking at the situation of security advisers, we see that in some countries it is mandatory for companies to have such safety advisers since 1 January of this year.", "At the moment this causes major control problems especially in small businesses, because they cannot afford it.", "Then either they will reject these goods or mix them with others and that will cause some problems.", "Therefore, an evaluation of these activities is being requested in the form of annual reports, business analysis, which could eventually be incorporated into the ISO 9002 certificates.", "The rules are, now there's control.", "Let me mention one last point.", "As far as control is concerned, we must reach good agreements with the countries of Eastern Europe, because until 1 July 2001, that is to say within a year and a half, they will not participate in the treaties on this subject.", "This gives them a temporary competitive advantage.", "It is not serious in itself, but what we should do in particular is to give priority to safety aspects in the transport of goods by road, rail and inland waterway and to incorporate this part of the acquis communautaire as quickly as possible and to submit it to the applicant countries.", "Madam President, this Parliament rightly pays regular attention to the importance of transport safety.", "The increasing quantities of goods that pass through Europe carry risks that we are aware of and sometimes unaware of, for the staff and for the social environment.", "People who have to handle these risks must therefore meet high requirements.", "The rules which have been drawn up for this purpose in another directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently appropriate to give reasonable advice to people on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.", "I am pleased that there is also an agreement with the Council on the minimum requirements for its examination, although I would have preferred to have fixed and uniform rules created, so that certificates would be the same from an international point of view.", "This, however, was not possible.", "Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur seems to me more than logical and therefore I fully support it.", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate our colleague, Mr Koch, on his reports, which may be technical reports, but which are of great importance for security.", "I would just like to make a few points.", "Firstly, I would like to ask the Commissioner - and I am sure that my wish falls on fertile soil - to pay more attention to the issue of safety, whether on the road, on the rail or on the waterways.", "When I see that the Commission's first amendment was tabled on 19 March 1998 and that we are still dealing with this - and in this respect Parliament has reacted relatively quickly - the period of time is too long.", "This is not the fault of the Commission alone now, but I believe that we must react more quickly and achieve greater harmonisation on this point.", "The second point has already been mentioned: minimum standards.", "I am essentially of the opinion that in many areas of transport greater flexibility and regulations developed by countries should be sought.", "In the case of security, I am somewhat sceptical because security in Sweden, for example, does not differ, in principle, from security in Germany, Italy or Austria.", "I can live with these minimum standards, but I ask the Commission to follow things real and carefully.", "If this kind of flexibility led to insufficient regulations in some countries, we should undertake further harmonisation.", "The third point has also been mentioned: just like our colleague, Mr Rack, I come from a transit country where this issue plays a special role.", "We do not want to worsen the conditions of competition unilaterally for some countries and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.", "But I believe that we must all do our utmost to restrict the transport of dangerous goods and, indeed, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.", "Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for his excellent work and for his positive cooperation with the Commission in improving the texts, in presenting this report and this proposal; in the end, there is only one amendment concerning the requirements for the examination of the suitability of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.", "We understand that cooperation is important, that the two institutions work together - Parliament and Commission - and that the cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular with the transport group, is excellent.", "The common position includes virtually all the amendments accepted by the Commission, harmonises the minimum requirements for the examinations of safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one proposed in principle by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have been discussing this issue for several years now.", "In short, I would also like to thank the various Members for their contribution and to tell them that safety is a priority for the Commission in the field of transport.", "And as Mr Simpson has rightly said, it can never be taken for granted or taken for granted or for the completion of the process.", "The process of increasing margins, guarantees of safety in transport is a process that needs to be improved day by day.", "In that regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, referred to by Mr Rack and Mr Swoboda, which, undoubtedly, in the case of Austria, is a very sensitive issue, so efforts must be made to see how to increase their safety.", "In one of the major accidents that occurred recently, the goods transported were not per se dangerous.", "The margarine and a few kilos of paint that, in principle, posed no risks, caused a real catastrophe.", "It is therefore necessary to see how the requirements to ensure maximum safety can be further refined.", "Finally, I would like to say that safety must be considered in all types of transport.", "This week we will have a debate here to discuss maritime transport safety, due to the Erika disaster, and we will have to discuss, over the course of this year, the safety objectives of air transport.", "But I would like to say, ladies and gentlemen, that security is a priority objective of the Commission.", "As I will say in the debate on the Erika, we do not wait for a catastrophe to turn us over to the security aspect, but we are working on it outside those circumstances, that all they do is show the urgency of an effective response to those kinds of problems.", "I would like to reiterate my thanks to all those who have spoken and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.", "The debate is closed.", "The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.", "Transport of dangerous goods by road", "The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)) amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road.", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains certain transitional provisions whose validity is subject to a deadline and is linked to the completion of certain standardisation work on CEN, i.e. the European Committee for Standardization.", "However, some delays in the work of CEN are causing problems in the implementation of this directive.", "In particular, it is not possible to adapt the annexes in accordance with technical and industrial development.", "I regret this, because we must act because others have not done their job.", "In this regard, I accept this proposal, which is being discussed today, on the amendment of Directive 94/55/EC.", "The inactivity of the European Union would require Member States to amend their intra-State legal rules for a short period of time, in particular until the conclusion of the work of the CEN, resulting in unnecessary costs and insecurities.", "Consequently, the amendment of the directive, which is on the agenda today, does not bring about any change in the harmonization of the transport of dangerous goods being carried out in the Community.", "It extends only certain transitional provisions by postponing time limits, does not abolish any more specific provisions and regulates procedures for (a) ad hoc transport of dangerous goods and (b) the adoption of less stringent national provisions, in particular in the case of the transport of very small quantities of dangerous goods in highly defined local territories.", "In this way the amendment of the directive is completely done in the sense of subsidiarity; the Member States acquire more powers.", "The EU Commission decides whether Member States can make certain provisions of their own.", "In this respect, it is assisted, in accordance with the regulatory procedure, by a Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods.", "The arrangements for the exercise of these implementing powers transferred to the Commission were first regulated by agreement of the Council in June 1999.", "The proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road, which is currently under discussion, dates from May 1999 and has therefore not yet been able to avail itself of the current comitology procedure.", "The amendments which have been tabled and which have been adopted unanimously in committee relate in just two cases to this modified comitology procedure.", "We would like to ensure that this is alluded to already in the recitals and that the imprecise time limit, within which the Council is to take a decision, is set at a maximum of three months.", "The need for greater transparency is also mentioned.", "Another amendment allows Member States to impose stricter requirements, especially for vacuum tanks, when work or transport is preferably to be carried out at temperatures considerably below 20 degrees below zero.", "This is of particular interest to the northern regions of Europe.", "A final amendment is intended to allow the continued use of tanks and tankers which entered into use between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive, if their construction and maintenance are in accordance with the provisions.", "Aware also that this is only a small step towards greater security, I ask you to agree to this report.", "Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, happy New Year and happy Millennium.", "I intervene for the first time in a plenary session, so this is exciting, a little like the first love, only that the first love lasted more than two minutes.", "I would like to comment briefly on the proposal put forward by the Commission to amend the existing directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.", "It is good that this directive should be adopted now because otherwise the Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very short period of time, for a transitional period, which in turn would only cause unnecessary costs and would once again increase the heads of the people in the face of the EU bureaucracy.", "However, the Commission proposal has not taken all factors into account, such as the cold climate in the northern regions.", "I therefore proposed some amendments to the splendid report by my colleague, Mr Koch, which were approved by our committee.", "My amendments concern the resistance to the low temperatures of the transport tanks of these dangerous goods.", "According to the Commission's proposal, resistance to 20 degrees below zero would have sufficed; it is difficult to imagine significantly lower temperatures in Lapland on the beaches of the Mediterranean.", "The EU is also supported in Lapland, so let us remember them.", "Therefore, I have proposed lowering the resistance limit to 40 degrees below zero.", "This would be truly necessary for the level of security to be maintained in the northern regions.", "I hope that my proposal will be taken into account in tomorrow's vote.", "Mr President, if you will allow me, I would like first of all to pay tribute to you for the manner in which you have made the swift change in the Presidency during the debate.", "I found it magnificent.", "I come to the point: I believe that the citizens of Europe can trust that what is transported in Europe by road, rail or inland waterways is transported as safely as possible, even though they are dangerous goods.", "This directive is a contribution to this.", "What we are doing today is scandalous.", "The rapporteur, Mr Koch, whom we thank for the work he has done, has mentioned that in substance everything could be more advanced if there were not this delay of the CENs who are very slow in drawing up and adapting the directive.", "For this reason, it is only up to us - and we should decide this this week - that in 2001 we finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road, so that at this point we have some legal certainty and also a little more safety on our roads.", "Mr President, the report we are dealing with does not represent major changes.", "Most of the amendments are purely technical in nature.", "However, it is worth stressing that such decisions are environmentally beneficial and create better conditions for the functioning of the internal market.", "Large quantities of dangerous goods are transported in the EU by road, rail and sea.", "Rules are needed to regulate this transport.", "Sector after sector is being regulated by minimum standards binding on Member States.", "This is extremely useful, and I thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for the work he has done on this matter.", "This is also important in terms of the conditions for the internal market.", "In order for the common transport market to actually function, it is not only important that there are rules, but also those rules, as far as possible, are common.", "Finally, I would like to comment on a third point which is also important, namely an amendment tabled by Mr Ari Vatanen.", "The conditions of the Member States differ in many respects.", "By adopting this amendment we take into account the fact that it can be very cold in the north.", "This also makes it necessary to bear in mind that this cold influences materials and packaging.", "Mr President, we have to be flexible when it comes to issuing rules.", "I hope that the Commission will accept this amendment.", "Mr President, I would not only like to thank our colleague, Mr Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission for having spoken so clearly and unambiguously in favour of safety in the field of transport and in favour of the priority of safety.", "Mr Koch has drafted his good report because the work has not been done so expeditiously in CEN and also in the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission.", "I would like to ask the Vice-President whether she can tell us today how things stand with regard to the harmonisation efforts of these two organisations and whether the EU has the possibility of speeding up harmonisation efforts in accordance with the simplest possible principles.", "Because it is clear that although we within the European Union adopt excellent regulation, transport does not stop at borders but goes beyond them.", "For this reason, comprehensive regulations, i.e. at the regional level, are certainly desirable.", "If the Commissioner is unable to do this today, would she be willing to send the committee a written statement of the state of affairs and the state of negotiations between CEN and the Committee on the Economy?", "Mr President, once again I congratulate Mr Koch on his work on this other report, which in some way completes the debate we had in October on rail transport.", "We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has not been able to carry out within the required time the modification of provisions necessary for proper harmonisation within the European Union.", "This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differential facts that speak of the diversity of our Europe.", "A moment ago Mr Vatanen was talking about lower temperatures, not at 20 degrees below zero, but at 40 degrees below zero.", "Of course we accept that amendment, it is absolutely right, and I believe that specific circumstances must be incorporated that speak of the climate variety of the European Union, which sometimes translates into specific features and specific requirements when considering technical normalisations or characterizations.", "I would like to say, with regard to what Mr Swoboda has said about CEN's activity, that we are urging them to speed up their work to the fullest extent because it would be dramatic if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves within a year and up against the same difficulties because it had not been completed.", "Finally, Mr President, the fundamental problems that justify this amendment of the directive have already been pointed out, we have referred to the delay in CEN, the modification of certain provisions, the consistency between the text of the directive and the contents of the annexes, the need to provide greater precision.", "All the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Koch, which have been translated into various amendments, namely four, are collected by the Commission.", "We therefore accept the four amendments that have been proposed to us.", "The debate is closed.", "The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.", "Coordination Structural Funds/Cohesion Fund", "The next item is the report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission communication on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for the 2000-2006 programmes (COM(1999)344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)).", "Mr President, I am particularly pleased that my first speech in the European Parliament touches on an issue that has been considered of the utmost importance to the part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament, namely Wales.", "As you know, a significant part of Wales has been given Objective I status under the Structural Funds programme.", "It is quite clear that many people in Wales rely on the European Structural Funds programme to solve some of the major difficulties they are undoubtedly facing.", "We can appreciate the increase in poverty in Wales, especially since 1997.", "The gulf between rich and poor has widened.", "We therefore hope that the Structural Funds programme will not only restructure industry, but also improve the whole economic base of the Principality.", "However, what is extremely damaging to us is the belief that the granting of Structural Funds is something that has, in a sense, been an achievement of the government.", "Sadly, it is only a recognition of the great difficulties that Wales is going through.", "That is why I would like to highlight some issues that I believe the Commission should have at the forefront.", "We count on the Commission to take account of the points relating to additionality.", "We are unhappy with the fact that these figures appear to have been somehow hidden within the United Kingdom as a whole.", "We are counting on the Commission to also ensure that there are funds tailored to projects.", "We are counting on this to challenge the UK government, to ensure that the private sector, which is surely the biggest target of Structural Fund spending, is involved in planning.", "Finally, we call for the Commission to ensure that Structural Fund money is spent in a transparent manner.", "There are too many things in this Parliament that are not transparent.", "This is a matter that will foster the friendship of the Commission and Wales.", "Mr President, our committee deals with these issues from a wide range of points of view, and I shall first speak from the point of view of the investigation.", "We believe that it is very positive that the draftsman of the opinion has incorporated into his own conclusions the proposal of our committee on the need to extend the research infrastructure in the countries covered by cohesion by placing higher schools and other training centres in such a way as to provide better service to the inhabitants of the less developed areas and to facilitate the stay of qualified people in their areas of origin.", "This is possible through the adoption of measures by public administrations, and this method of territorial leisure in the location of higher education is undoubtedly an efficient policy for levelling development.", "Another issue to which we wanted to pay attention, particularly from the point of view of industrial policy, is that we would have wanted the Commission to take more account of the effects of the growth of services, electronic commerce and the use of the Internet when planning the coordination of the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds.", "In the past, poverty and wealth depended on the structures of economic activities.", "The rich regions were the ones with the highest number of jobs in the industrial sector, but today these areas can become a burden and even poor, and, if so, new investments must be made in the so-called sectors of computer production and service production, since these are the sectors of the future.", "This aspect has not been sufficiently taken into account by the committee responsible for drawing up the report, so on behalf of the Committee on Industry, I draw the Commission's attention to this matter.", "Finally, we would have hoped, as the Committee on Energy, that the need to subsidize renewable energies with the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds would have been further highlighted, and that would have been possible to increase, through the coordination of the two Funds, the use of renewable energies, so that the lack of financial resources for the energy programme would have been offset by the granting of these considerable economic aid.", "Mr President, I would like to express my deep thanks to Mr Schroedter for his contribution to this issue and for explaining to colleagues that I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Mr Flautre, who happened in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but is unfortunately ill.", "I would like people to pay attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which, however, have been rejected by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.", "These amendments concern the social economy and the need to provide social venture capital and to support local financing schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.", "In the past, Parliament regarded the social economy as a major potential provider of employment.", "These amendments also agree with the idea of this Parliament that social exclusion is a serious issue that requires constructive action.", "We hope that those who are considering rejecting these amendments will offer Parliament and the citizens of their countries who are seeking employment very powerful reasons for doing so.", "Mr Flautre stressed in his report an area in which coordination is clearly lacking, although it is urgently needed.", "The Commission's proposals refer to the four pillars of the employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.", "But we must particularly regret the absence of specific guidelines, because the idea of linking Social Fund support to the employment strategy will be put into practice for the first time in the 2000-2006 programme.", "It could be said that the omission suggests that the Commission also has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between the European Social Fund aid, which is subject to review after three and a half years, and the annual employment plans of the Member States.", "We hope that the Commission will be able to assure us that this is an oversight which is being constructively remedied.", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal submitted by the Commission, fulfilling its mandate, is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.", "But I would like to stress here that this starting point indicates the challenges we face: to keep the population in rural areas, in the face of the changes that are taking place in all kinds of economic activities due to the growing loss of weight in the agricultural sector among the various sources of income in rural society.", "This, coupled with weaknesses in infrastructure and service networks, and generally very low and seasonally and poorly diversified job supply, accentuates the exodus from rural areas.", "The consequences don't wait.", "It is young people who disappear, who acquire training and find employment outside rural areas, which has an adverse impact on these same areas.", "This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to business start-ups and job creation.", "It should be borne in mind that rural areas account for almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union.", "Agriculture only provides 5.5% of the employment of this same Union.", "In addition, three-quarters of our farmers are part-time farmers and need effective supplements to their incomes.", "For this reason, one of the most important and far-reaching objectives that we should set ourselves in the European Union is to develop efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage recovery, implementation, business transformation, new technologies, services, etc. However, while the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it remains essential not only to prevent the economic and social disintegration of rural areas and the creation of other ghost cities, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the territory, preserving biodiversity and protecting the environment.", "We therefore advocate the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy consistent with the objectives we have set and that rural areas, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, must be competitive and multifunctional, both on the agricultural side and open to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.", "It is important to give priority to general criteria for spatial planning and population balance, and to take account of the conclusions reached by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in five key areas, which have only been partly reflected in points 16 and 17 of the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism.", "In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when setting the conclusions of the four pillars because I understand that, for the European Union, the setting of the population in rural areas should be one of the priority objectives.", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter, the rapporteur, for her work.", "I think it's a very well done job.", "And I would also like to thank you for your willingness to dialogue with the other political groups when it comes to compromise formulas in the face of this avalanche of amendments, perhaps more than was expected, but which really respond to the importance of the report we are talking about.", "It is important for us that the conclusions adopted in this Parliament be taken into account by the Commission, at least in their spirit, because as far as we are concerned, it might seem that we are doing a useless, purely rhetorical exercise here.", "But the truth is that we believe, and that is also reflected in the letter of the conclusions, that the Commission must take account of what is adopted in this Parliament, primarily in view of the revision of these guidelines at the mid-term.", "In our amendments, we have laid down the importance for us of producing the necessary synergies between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives, so that their implementation is best reflected, in the most cost-effective way, in the progressive elimination of inequalities between regions and in the creation of jobs which, in short, are the two fundamental purposes of the funds we are talking about.", "And in order to get a faster and more effective boost in achieving these objectives, we believe that it is necessary to involve in this initiative the job creators, the true entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee the new sources of employment, which are the entrepreneurs.", "Especially small and medium-sized entrepreneurs have to participate in the distribution of these funds.", "If this is not the case, if entrepreneurs feel marginalized, if entrepreneurs cannot participate, I say not just in the management, but in the receipt of these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to achieve our objectives more quickly.", "In order to achieve our objectives, it is also important to make a strong commitment to new technologies, transport and communications networks and renewable energy to overcome inequalities between regions and to seek sources of employment.", "And all this - I insist - with the participation of the private company that, joining its efforts to that of the public administrations, complementing itself and never obstructing or excluding itself, is the one that will create social wealth and jobs.", "Mr President, it is my responsibility to remind my colleague Mr Evans of the reason why Wales has actually achieved Objective I status. It is because of the discredited policies of its own Conservative Party.", "Let me also remind you that when the leader of your party, Mr Hague, was Secretary of State for Wales, he violated all the articles in the additionality book, which led to a severe letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies on regulatory requirements.", "I can tell you that the British Government is aware of the regulatory requirements for the additionality of Objective I. I suggest that Mr Evans read the regulation again.", "My group has made important amendments to the two reports that are being discussed today.", "I want us to focus on the important role that the guidelines play.", "The aim is to provide a framework and a tool to support and improve economic regeneration, to achieve the most effective use of resources with the broadest support and to redirect these regions to the path of recovery and sustained development so that they eventually leave the regional assisted breathing system.", "It is important to identify the capabilities and potential of our regions in the high-tech sector.", "This is particularly important in the light of media reports suggesting that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in terms of the growth of high-tech industries in the future.", "The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive because it suggests what guidelines should not produce.", "They should not create layers of additional bureaucracy and paperwork.", "Priorities and policies must not change while the project is being developed, which leads to unavoidable delays and underexpenditures, especially in the light of new budgetary requirements.", "The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of either department, the Commission or the civil servant.", "There must be internal coherence in the direction of the Commission while respecting the specific regional and local aspects of the Commission's programmes.", "The conclusion is that we must emphasize that the guidelines are general, clear and flexible so that they can help programme managers and fund users and maximize the potential of our new regeneration fields.", "If we can instill a spirit of entrepreneurship in our poor and structurally weak regions, we will eventually put them on the path of attracting investor confidence, which will be the key to future success.", "This is how we will judge the success of these guidelines: depending on whether EU regional policies, with good, strong and enabling guidelines, can open up new opportunities and enable our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full role in EU growth and prosperity.", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for her good report; she has fully applied herself to the matter and has taken very well into account, during the work of the committee, many changes made to this report.", "The rapporteur for the report has also rightly noted that Parliament has not been listened to in time with regard to the guidelines.", "We are now seriously behind on this issue.", "However, it is to be hoped that Parliament's conclusions will assist in the mid-term review of programmes and their practical implementation.", "If we take into account the phase of the period we are living in, the report has been expanding too much during its preparation.", "The report has included specific issues and a number of other issues that had already been present in previous reports.", "At this stage, the most important thing is to focus on examining ways of channelling the Union's regional policy through this process, recalling that the aim is to reduce inequalities between regions.", "Our group emphasises the principle of subsidiarity: the responsibility of the Member States and the importance of local actors in drawing up and implementing programmes.", "It is of fundamental importance that small and medium-sized enterprises participate in the planning and implementation of programmes.", "Our group also considers it very important that the overseas territories and peripheral areas be better taken into account, and we want greater interaction between cities and rural areas.", "We reject the exaggerated protection of the central administrations of the Member States and the Union, and we demand that the bureaucracy that has infiltrated the process of drawing up and implementing the programmes be reduced.", "The effectiveness of projects carried out under Union grants has too often been undermined by slow decision-making and the complexity of administrative procedures.", "Funds have often been granted for projects that have left no permanent benefit in the area of implementation.", "Projects must be made more effective, flexible and productive.", "On the occasion of the preparation of this report, it was also very interesting to have a debate on the Union's regional policy at a general level.", "It was the first time that the new Members had taken part in a similar debate, and this is a very interesting process.", "This report is excellent and has the support of our group.", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as proof that this Parliament has not yet passed the consultative and subordinate institution stage, the excellent report by my colleague from the Elisabeth Schroedter Group has not been able to reach the plenary, because the regional development plans for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 territories have already been in the Commission's cabinets for several months.", "With all this in mind, we must, in any event, demand, from this House, that, before the Community support frameworks for this period are adopted, they be studied and debated in this House in the light of precisely the guidelines we are presenting today, because we consider their ability to create jobs in the poorest or least developed territories very special, thereby helping to change the negative trends to inequality in European society and to move towards a fairer Europe.", "Mr President, we should not forget that the main and strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds, and their coordination, is to achieve economic and social cohesion.", "We have an obligation to participate in the development of guidelines and also in the evaluation of results.", "This is because we are the representatives of citizens in the Citizens' Europe, and not just in a Europe of the states and regions.", "We find that the Funds are a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.", "If we take the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the only indicator, we can be mistaken.", "Some colleagues have already talked about unemployment, the decline in demographics.", "We will have to study a few indicators that allow us to see the state and evolution of regional societies that are worse off than others.", "It is clear from some reports before Parliament today that the 25 most prosperous European regions have five times less unemployment than the 25 less prosperous regions.", "This obliges the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission to act decisively and strategically.", "I agree that the European Parliament has not had the opportunity - or has not been given, as the end of the legislature - to talk about the guidelines.", "But I don't think the report is late.", "We need a joint reflection so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the regional development plans that have been drawn up before the guidelines are operational can be reviewed and assessed.", "There is a need to coordinate the programmes of the various objectives, and we all agree that, halfway through these programmes, when the guidelines are evaluated, Parliament can be a co-star, because we are the representatives of the citizens.", "Citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a manner, at least apparently, bureaucratic.", "They need the political dimension to work, there are responsibilities, there is communication with citizens.", "That is what we are asking the Commissioner today.", "I would like to think that he will agree, from his previous experience as regional President, to propose indicators and a strategy for economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.", "Mr President, I support the main proposals in the report on the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations in the report which recommend the following: there must always be an integrated approach to expenditure on the Structural Funds and the EU Cohesion Fund.", "This means that there must be full cooperation between local authorities and national governments on how these funds should be spent.", "Member States are called upon to place greater emphasis on integrated strategies to revitalize urban-rural relations.", "This last point is of particular importance.", "Although urban renewal of our cities is very important, it is always necessary to strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of the inhabitants of the cities.", "It is not our wish to build a Europe of cities alone.", "The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development of both urban and rural areas in peripheral countries, mainly through the modernisation of roads, water treatment and related transport networks.", "This process will continue in line with the financial spending guidelines agreed by EU leaders at last year's Berlin Summit, which were supported by Parliament at last May's plenary session.", "The key EU programmes between 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have certainly contributed to improving the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and regions of Europe covered by Objective 1.", "The key now is to consolidate and make permanent progress to date.", "This will ensure that the peripheral countries and the outermost regions, the poorest regions of Europe, are able to operate successfully within the new euro area as well as in the area of a constantly expanding internal market where there is free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.", "In conclusion, although the key infrastructure projects have been financed by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, we must remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society.", "The European Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions, funded our post-secondary education programmes and implemented far-reaching plans to help combat youth and long-term unemployment, help early school dropouts and promote higher levels of adult literacy.", "Mr President, in the past I have repeatedly disagreed with the rapporteur on the approach to regional policy issues; this time, however, I agree with her.", "I do not know whether this encourages her to continue in the same direction, but I would like to place on record my congratulations.", "The second thing I would like to say is that we - as Mrs McCarthy and myself, as rapporteurs of the general rules of procedure, proposed - would prefer the guidelines to have been annexed as an appendix to the rules of procedure.", "Unfortunately this has not been done, and it is not the responsibility of Mr Berni\u00e9; it is the responsibility of the previous committee.", "I will put this on record to repeat Parliament's position.", "The third point I should like to make is that, of course, we generally agree with the guidelines, as soon as they do not depart from the comments we have made.", "They are an important aid for the Member States, and I would like to stress in particular the importance that the Commission attaches to the issue of sustainable development, to increasing employment, with particular attention to equal opportunities, as well as to transport issues.", "As far as I am concerned personally, I completely agree.", "Beyond this, however, I would like to express my disgust as an islander because of the lack of interest in the development of the islands.", "It is not given the importance it should be given, and this is not the first time it has happened; it is already an old story in these five years in which I am a member of Parliament and in which I have not stopped raising the issue.", "Commissioner, we are going to continue to raise this issue, because there is provision for this in the first paragraph of Article 158 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which speaks of a comprehensive policy for the islands, and the Commission will therefore have to examine this specific issue once and for all.", "From now on, Commissioner, the time has finally come for the implementation of the programmes, so that the Member States will also have to shoulder their responsibilities and do their job well.", "As far as we are concerned, here in Parliament, what I would like to recall is that there is a code of good conduct between Parliament and the Commission, signed and in force since May.", "I am fully convinced that this code will be respected and that Parliament will be kept informed of all the progress and details of the implementation of these programmes.", "Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work she has done.", "I believe that in the coming years, faced with the challenge of globalisation and enlargement to the East, Europe will need more than ever adequate and precise guidelines for programming and relaunching its economy.", "In this respect, Europe as a whole, and each Member State in particular, must make the best use of all its resources and potentialities and, therefore, also of the Structural Funds at its disposal.", "To do so requires a European Commission which, beyond good intentions, makes its guidelines more transparent and makes every effort to monitor the use of these funds by the Member States.", "Italy, for example, has had problems in recent years with the use of the Structural Funds, mainly due to excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and limited involvement of economic and social actors at local level.", "I'm sorry.", "I would therefore like to draw the Commission's attention to two points: firstly, we need to make the best use of consultation as a system of coordination and participation in the decisions of all local and regional actors in order to avoid imbalances and inequalities; secondly, we need real work to simplify and transparent administrative procedures, which are often too long and too complex to the extent that they adversely affect access to the funds, which is particularly regrettable for small and medium-sized enterprises.", "I'm sorry.", "I conclude, Mr President, by saying that it is rather serious that the Commission communication did not focus on territorial pacts and especially on ways of combating unemployment among women and young people.", "Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a special pleasure for me to raise this issue in my first speech in this House, especially because I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has benefited in particular from Objective 2 funds.", "But the report presented to the House this afternoon is a great example of how, if we are not very cautious, we can produce grandiose ideas that lack substance to make them relevant to people who benefit directly from them.", "The report itself contains good intentions but, as is often the case when dealing with these issues, it lacks clarity of purpose and a solid basis for its functioning.", "That is why my group and I are proposing three key amendments and additional proposals to the text, not with the intention of removing everything from the proposal, but rather making it more relevant to those who are to carry it out.", "I'd like to explain what we think here.", "Firstly, we are concerned about the proper use of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds.", "Past experience dictates that, as elected representatives of European taxpayers, we must and must demand probity and financial transparency in the disbursement and audit of this money. Therefore, our additional amendments and proposals relate to achieving what we know as \"value-for-money\" indicators in the aid process.", "Secondly, we have all too often seen huge amounts of money being spent on projects whose results are necessarily imprecise in the initial phase of the programme period.", "But, too often, at the mid-point or end of that period there is no real way to complete the project if its effectiveness has not been proven.", "Therefore, our additional proposals advocate the provision of practical exit strategies and that they can be enforced so that we can not only have the required insurance against the already acquired costs that are usually charged to the taxpayer, but also avoid the well-known syndrome of losing more money when trying to recover the already lost.", "Finally, we advocate the introduction of a change in the balance and method of disbursement of funds.", "There must be greater commitment from the private sector, which must present financial reality as an element of the funding equation.", "Also, the type of project financed requires moving away from small-scale income-based projects, which are difficult to monitor, to capital plans where in most cases we can all clearly appreciate the benefits.", "In this way the much-feeling need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to resort unnecessarily as soon as possible to the local tax base in the areas where these projects are being developed will diminish, and the European Parliament will show that the need for such reform is being taken seriously.", "If today the House supports the introduction of these changes in the report, I believe that they will put us at a later stage, at which the historic objectives that the funds must meet will be achieved, that is to say to help in a financially sustainable way the most deprived areas of the European Union whose standard of living requires an increase, not by giving them alms, but by pushing them.", "I call on the House to support these changes.", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report; it is hard and thorough work.", "There can be no doubt that the structural policies and cohesion policy of the European Union are the primary tools for creating the conditions that make possible the development and progressive elimination of economic and social inequalities between regions; inequalities that, despite the progress made, remain at very high levels; intolerablely high, particularly with regard to unemployment.", "In order to achieve the highest possible degree of success in achieving the objectives of these policies, they need to be coordinated and organised on the basis of well-developed, intelligently developed guidelines, I would say.", "Let us not forget that these policies, when effective, are also visible to the European citizen, who benefits from them and sees the immediate improvement of their quality of life.", "Let us not forget, too, that special attention will have to be paid to the remotest regions and to the island regions of the European Union, because, because of their geographical location, they face fundamental obstacles in their economic and social development, unless, of course, the Commission intends to build bridges and submarine tunnels to connect them to the European trunk.", "In conclusion, I would like to stress that structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility, so that they adapt to changing circumstances and thus respond to the new challenges and opportunities that arise with the advent of the new millennium, for which we all have the best wishes.", "Mr President, Mrs Schroedter's report certainly contains quite a few important points, and I congratulate her on that.", "I believe, however, that we should be more concerned about the direction and results of the Community's regional policy.", "Broadly speaking, the enormous mass unemployment is not only not reduced, but is further aggravated in the framework of structural policy.", "The agricultural economy and rural areas are irreparably affected by the regional policy being pursued, with dramatic consequences for rural employment and for the living conditions of farmers, mainly in the South.", "Regional inequalities are dramatically increasing within the Member States.", "If we look at the data in the sixth report, we will see that there have been huge deviations over the last decade from the regional development average.", "At least, if not non-existent, it is the attention paid to the enormous problems of the island regions of the Union, whose deficiencies in infrastructure, transport, communications and energy inevitably lead to depopulation.", "Regional policy and the Union's broader economic and social policy are responsible for all this.", "Broad sections of the peoples of the Union strongly condemn this policy as dangerous and anti-popular.", "The new guidelines are unfortunately moving in the same direction and there is nothing to suggest that it can change with the application of these guidelines.", "Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say a few words here to underline two points which these reports remind us of and which are of crucial strategic importance in the perspective we have of the Union.", "The first is the essential and fundamental importance that we continue to attach to the principle of economic and social cohesion.", "And we express concern at the news that the importance of this objective is falling in the spirit of the Commission.", "We continue to regard economic and social cohesion as a fundamental objective of the Union.", "Secondly, I agree with the words heard here from a Member on the question of the islands and I would also like to draw attention to the outermost regions.", "We would like to see more boldness in the future in dealing with the issue of the outermost regions, such as the Azores and Madeira, in the case of my country.", "And I take this opportunity to ask whether the Commission can clarify to us the reasons for the delay in the Commission's report on the outermost regions, which has long been expected of Parliament.", "Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, also for the kind welcome she gave in her report to some of our suggestions.", "Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, with the help of the guidelines, the aim is to provide the Member States with guidance to achieve the objectives of the reform in the context of programming.", "However, the objectives formulated by the Commission in this respect, contrary to its intention to provide guidance, represent rather a catalogue of offers of possible measures in the field of policy.", "However, its true meaning is to indicate direction and to set priorities.", "I agree with the rapporteur that, unfortunately, the Commission document contains too few recommendations to the Member States on administrative simplification and I support certain requirements, such as focusing during the negotiations on promoting a favourable environment for small and medium-sized enterprises, such as job creation, in clearly setting targets for alternative sources of finance, including regulations on venture capital and private financing, in creating start-up aid for enterprises, including new technologies as well as investments in the field of innovation.", "I particularly support an amendment by my group to paragraph 10, which seeks to ensure that the private sector is properly included in the planning and implementation of projects.", "I would very much welcome, Mrs Schroedter, for you to include this amendment in your positive arguments, particularly in terms of subsidiarity.", "Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs we maintained the unanimous view that it was a strategic and priority to support structural and cohesion fund interventions that worked for a better employment opportunity for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.", "Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report has not taken this criterion into account, despite the fact that there are many evidence - and we will see it later in the Berend report - of how these Funds are indeed splendidly helping the regions lagging behind to cover the distance between them and the more developed regions of Europe.", "They are growing, but at GDP levels.", "They are growing in competitiveness, but they do not reach all the increase in wealth because employment is not increased and the gap in employment opportunities persists in both regions.", "Commissioner, you read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and give it priority, because this is the great problem for citizens.", "And in the revision, in the allocation of reserves, take account, strategically, of employment needs because that is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds ultimately require.", "Mr President, the guidelines must be able to guide properly and strengthen the effectiveness of the programmes of the critic in September 2000-2006, so that sustainable development and job creation, especially for women and young people, can finally be achieved, and that the balance between social and economic policies and environmental policy is ensured.", "Of particular importance is the treatment of the acute problems of cities, the maintenance of rural employment, support for agricultural areas and, of course, the guarantee of equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union, and for the Greek islands, of course, which are half of the islands of the Union, as exactly provided for in Article 158 of the Treaty.", "Cohesion policy must be further consolidated and strengthened, because a Europe with enormous inequalities in the living standards of the regions cannot be credible or viable.", "The debate is closed.", "The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.", "Situation and socio-economic developments in the regions of the Union", "The next item is the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the situation and socio-economic developments in the regions of the European Union (SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)).", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this sixth periodic report on the situation and socio-economic developments in the regions of the European Union indicates that a threshold has been crossed in the analysis of regional data, and reveals the progress made in this area since the fifth periodic report.", "However, I believe that if one thinks of a true convergence of average regional levels of development in Europe, one will see a reality somewhat alienated from the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message that appears in the press and in the speech of many people.", "The Commission's report very much relativises this finding, especially when it refers to the socio-economic situation in certain regions of the Union which are very close to my heart: I am referring to the French overseas departments and, more generally, to the outermost regions.", "In this respect, I am pleased that the Committee on Regional Policy has adopted one of my amendments, which calls for the Commission to reserve a special chapter in its next report on cohesion to the particular case of the ultraperiphery and, more specifically, to the analysis of the impact of the measures to be taken shortly pursuant to the new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.", "Finally, it seems to me that the sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the point of view of a real project for the sustainable and balanced development of the European territory, in particular because it summarizes the importance of the link between the centre of Europe and its periphery.", "Although the Commission still has doubts as to how to express it in a very explicit way, its periodic report shows us the urgency of promoting a polycentric development of the Community area, through the Union's structural policies and within the framework of the management initiated by the ESA.", "Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report just presented by Mr Berend and congratulates his author, both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility, which has allowed amendments from the various groups to be incorporated into committee.", "It should be recalled that the overall competitiveness of the European Union is currently 81 per cent of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if it improves that of our competitive units, which are the regions, and this, moreover, at a time when technological developments, economic globalisation and our problems, enlargement and the single currency make the regions, but also businesses and individuals, more competitive efforts.", "The sixth report of the European Commission offers very valuable conclusions.", "I sum up two of them, as the rapporteur has already pointed out, one positive and one negative.", "The first is that significant progress has been made in territorial and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been an important but not decisive factor in reducing regional inequalities.", "The refusal is that this great effort that has been made was more effective in bringing the GDP and productivity of the European regions closer than in terms of their employment levels.", "There is therefore a need to link structural funding more closely to job creation.", "It is, Commissioner, the first commandment for the next period.", "So, Mr President, I ask my honourable colleagues to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as other colleagues have done, to bear in mind the conclusions of your Sixth Periodic Report in view of the programming for the period 2000-2006.", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his good work and for having taken due account of the amendments proposed during the process of drawing up the report in the committee.", "This sixth periodic report lays down the basis for assessing the achievement of the objectives of the Union's regional policy.", "The report shows that despite all the efforts made, growth is uneven.", "The regions of Central Europe continue to experience very rapid development.", "The more prosperous centres also continue to grow above the European average, while many regions of southern and northern Europe are developing much more slowly.", "We now need a thorough analysis of the reasons why regional policy does not achieve the desired results in all regions.", "Is this because of bureaucracy or because differences between regions, such as large distances, extreme weather conditions of cold or heat, low population density and lack of soil fertility, have not been sufficiently taken into account?", "How can the Union cope with the challenges posed by the globalisation process so that the most backward regions can be integrated into it?", "It is also important to find out what effects the enlargement of the Union will have on the Structural Funds and the development of peripheral regions.", "Member States must also remember their responsibilities.", "Some Member States have flouted the principle of compensation and reduced national subsidies to the regions as the Structural Funds from the Union have increased.", "This has neutralized the results of regional policy.", "In the future, the development of indicators will also need to be considered in order to be able to take appropriate measures and target them at suitable locations.", "For example, migration movements have not been sufficiently taken into account.", "In this context, it should be stressed that small and medium-sized enterprises play a decisive role as job creators and drivers of regional development.", "It is vitally important to transfer state-of-the-art technologies and know-how to businesses in regions with slower developments.", "Our group supports the adoption of this report.", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Community's territorial policy has so far failed to reflect significantly the differences in per capita income.", "The situation is serious, so that today there is even a clear link between unemployment and poverty in the European Union, as demonstrated by the fact - very worrying - that unemployment reaches, on average, 23.7 per cent in the territories most affected by this problem, territories that coincide with poor areas, while in the 25 territories with the least unemployment, corresponding to the rich areas, unemployment is only 4 per cent.", "In view of this situation, the report approved by Parliament should make clear the need for measures aimed unequivocally at combating relative poverty and unemployment, measures such as the proper implementation of the Structural Funds, which are often poorly spent, for these purposes, through centralized State policies, the modernisation of telecommunications and communications, in particular by integrating the less developed territories into the trans-European railway networks by the year 2007, respect for and development of the agricultural and fishing resources and capacities of those countries, often attacked by the own policies of an insensitive European Union, the promotion of active employment creation policies, preferably for women and young people.", "Only through the determined implementation of such measures can social and territorial inequality be overcome, which is not the historical product of inevitable defects, but of marginalization and negative economic policies.", "Mr President, my congratulations to the rapporteur on his very thorough report.", "The central objective of the Structural Funds is to increase social and economic cohesion between regions in the European Union.", "By encouraging investments of different kinds, the European Union is trying to raise per capita GDP and create more jobs.", "From the sixth periodic report on the regions it can be concluded with caution that these stimuli do not always have the desired effect.", "Efforts to increase GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always lead to such an increase, and it is therefore not a very satisfactory result for a period in which, particularly in recent years, economic progress has been seen.", "Moreover, as the rapporteur points out, the impact of structural measures on employment levels is limited.", "Certain reservations should therefore be reserved as to the effectiveness of Community aid.", "The finding that differences between regions within the Member States sometimes even increase, also raises serious questions.", "Mr President, for these reasons I think it is useful and necessary to pay attention to both national and regional administrations in terms of promoting employment.", "After all, it is they who have the most knowledge of the regions under their responsibility.", "If they are charged with drawing up plans that are more tailored to the needs of the regions concerned and if they are financed in case of need, then higher returns can be achieved.", "And this is ultimately the ultimate goal.", "I therefore sincerely agree that the Commission should leave to the Member States and the regions the practical design and implementation of these measures.", "Perhaps, in relation to the above, it will be more useful in any case to give greater weight to the Member States in terms of financial support from the regions.", "We can avoid many problems in the future by shifting the criteria for regions to the Member States.", "Finally, I would like to pay attention to the situation in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe.", "It follows from the report that, as a general rule, they are lagging behind the countries of the European Union, especially in terms of GDP per inhabitant.", "The planned entry of a large number of these countries soon forces us to review the current structural policy.", "I would now like to appeal to the Commission, as others have already done, to put forward some proposals for reform soon.", "Distinguished Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, following a careful analysis of this report, it is clear that only partially the proposed objective of structural policy has been met.", "Thus, among other things, the disparity between regions has increased rather than decreased, the Member States show at this point a certain approximation.", "Similarly, in the most heavily affected regions, the number of unemployed has barely been reduced; even these have increased in part.", "I therefore wonder why the resources of the Structural Funds have not been used efficiently.", "Even the accumulation of resources from the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds have not produced the desired effect in all regions and countries.", "Once the stated objective of all politicians across Europe is to reduce unemployment, the critical question must be raised as to whether the policy that has been implemented is the right one or whether it will not be more effective to strengthen the competitiveness of the regions through relevant measures such as increasing funding for research and development, improving infrastructure or raising the level of education.", "Serious structural reforms and a competitive fiscal and tax policy are the constructive elements of the success of an economic zone.", "If we want to avoid the reproach that we are pursuing a high-cost structural policy that in the long term will not move anything on the issue of employment, we need to review the measures that have been implemented so far.", "The Union's structural policy will be successful when sufficient jobs are created and the unemployment rate falls significantly.", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur on the treatment he has given to this important issue, since the state of socio-economic developments will decide what judgement European citizens make on the correctness of our work.", "This is an issue that influences the daily lives of citizens and is key from the point of view of the credibility of the EU.", "It must be acknowledged that the EU has already supported, I would say, even extraordinarily, the development of the poorest countries.", "I remember the state of Portugal and Greece when I first drove through these countries, 25 years ago.", "In this sense, those who speak French will surely tell the EU \"coup de chapeau\" , i.e. take off my hat.", "It is true that the EU deserves us to discover ourselves before it, but, within countries, the differences between rich regions and poor regions remain too large.", "What are the consequences of this?", "People react by voting with their feet, that is, leaving in search of bread elsewhere.", "So we are forced to build the entire infrastructure again and again, for the same people and in the same country, schools and hospitals.", "This is very expensive and also causes very serious social problems.", "However, most of the population would like to live in their home region, provided they were given the opportunities to do so, that is, if there was work.", "We must provide that opportunity.", "This is a moral obligation of the EU and of all of us.", "I believe that the solution is to stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit in a clear way.", "And with an entrepreneurial spirit, I am not referring exclusively to the fact that I own a company, but I understand the expression as a state of the will.", "I am referring to the attitude, that the person has the desire to prosper in life, whether he is an employee, an owner of an enterprise or an official.", "What is a just society like?", "It is a society in which anyone of humble origin can thrive in life, so that their children can enjoy a more exploding situation.", "The optimum development of the regions is therefore also possible, as citizens do undertake and work, if they are given opportunities to do so.", "In conclusion, I would say that, in this respect, we should take an example from the United States, where industriousness has become fashionable again and success is a manifestation of personal worth, and not an object of envy, as is often the case here in Europe.", "Mr President, as all speakers have done, I should like to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of this work.", "As in the case of the previous report, this analysis of great competence and precision, the recommendations made in it and the comments made by honourable Members will be very useful to the Commission in general and, in particular, to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy, at the time when we are embarking on the programming of appropriations 2000-2006.", "For my part, I would like to make a few comments, first of all on the rapporteur's judgment on this sixth periodic report.", "The honourable Member has stressed quality and even, if I am not mistaken, has written that, in relation to precedents, it is a real improvement.", "On behalf of all the officials of the Commission and of my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I must tell you that we have been very sensitive to this assessment by the House and the honourable Member personally.", "It is true that the Commission has endeavoured, Mr Berend, to ensure that this sixth periodic report shows that an effort has been made to overcome a qualitative scale in the analysis proposed to you.", "I am thinking above all of the content of Chapter 2.1 of this report, where the Commission examined in more depth the economic definitions of regional competitiveness, and sought to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness can be sustained, improved and influenced by factors that Mr Markov, right now, or previously Mrs Raschhofer, emphasised with great vehementness.", "I am referring to technological research and development, infrastructure endowment and quality, human resource potential, small and medium-sized enterprises, direct investment from abroad.", "This is about quality.", "I do not want to dwell now, Mr rapporteur, on the details of my ideas on the general points that this House has already subscribed to.", "I will quote them telegraphically: the first refers to the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy, in particular in negotiating programming documents with the Member States.", "The second point is the partnership, on which several Members have insisted, the role of local and regional authorities, the private sector, social partners, the society sector and local animation groups.", "I shall be extremely vigilant about the proper implementation, on this issue of partnership, of the provisions of the general regulation on the Structural Funds.", "The third point is the need to develop the employment content of growth and, if I remember correctly, Mr Van Dam said a few moments ago that the first responsibility lies with the Member States, and that when we talk about the responsibility of the Member States, as well as the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy, we must take very good account of the period in which we stand.", "A few moments ago, Mr Fruteau stated that the benefits of growth are unevenly shared.", "I would remind you, Your Honor, that there needs to be growth and that we are not globally in a period of stagnation or recession, as has happened in the past.", "The honourable Member will tell me that growth or recession does not affect everyone.", "I agree with your analysis.", "It is necessary that, where there is, growth be better spread, but what is even more difficult and even more severe affects regions affected by remoteness, whether outermost or island, is the lack of growth that has been experienced throughout the world over the past two decades.", "The fourth point, on which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen has just stressed, is the promotion of a policy of equal opportunities for women and young people.", "The fifth point concerns the importance and role of small and medium-sized enterprises, and Mr Vatanen has just referred to it with great vibrancy.", "Finally, there are the positive effects on national administrations of the Structural Funds management system, the motivation of officials when managing these funds, even if it is sometimes complicated, and the importance of making repeated improvements to the Commission's evaluation, monitoring and monitoring procedures.", "In this respect, I would like to inform the European Parliament that I intend to organise a seminar with the national and regional authorities in mid-2000 precisely on this subject of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practices in the management of the Structural Funds.", "I would like to recall a few specific points.", "Mr. Berend expressed the hope that the division into areas would take place quickly.", "We're done with the division into areas.", "Tomorrow the Commission will announce its decision on four new countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy's turn.", "That is to say, their wish will be fulfilled, because all the countries involved in Objective 2 will be divided into areas.", "With regard to the shadow economy which the honourable Member pointed out in his report, I know that the analysis and statistics on this matter are based on the reliability of the data and, as Mr Cocilovo pointed out, there is a problem of reliability in those data.", "To some extent, they are included in GDP statistics, labour force surveys and, in any case, I must underline the efforts that Eurostat is making and will continue to make to improve the quality of statistics.", "The rapporteur, like Mr Aparicio S\u00e1nchez, recalled the absence of reforms in the fisheries sector.", "On this subject, which concerns me personally, I will recall that the small size of the sector - which does not mean that it is negligible - and its concentration in a very small number of regions do not facilitate its analysis in a regional framework.", "This type of sectoral analysis depends rather on the practice and competence of the Directorate-General for Fisheries, which is in charge of my colleague Fischler.", "However, I assure you that the Commission will endeavour to include such an analysis in the second cohesion report, which will certainly be more appropriate to those concerns.", "Several Members mentioned the points to be included in this second report on cohesion, and the rapporteur recalled some of them.", "First of all, I would like to assure you that the merger of the periodic reports and the cohesion report should not imply any loss of information or interest in the content of the second, which for me, Mr rapporteur, is an instrument of extreme importance, not only to be warned about what has been done and to be said in a transparent and rigorous manner, to examine or value future guidelines, but also to create a public debate with the citizens and, beyond that, with those elected by them, which are Members, on this regional policy and on what could one day be a European policy for managing the territory.", "In any case, I have taken good note of the wish to include in the report the following points: the definition, collection and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe; a chapter on the islands and the outermost regions that many Members recalled, especially Mrs Sudre and Mr Fruteau; the analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the case of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe: this will be the great challenge for us, for Members, for the Commission, in the coming years; finally, the cross-border aspects.", "On all these issues I will do my utmost to follow up on your recommendations.", "I would also like to draw your attention to the political conclusions which, for the rest, all Members are aware of, but whose main points I would like to recall.", "Ladies and gentlemen, on the road to real convergence, significant progress has been made, particularly in the four cohesion Member States, but also, Mr Pohjamo, I say quite frankly, in the Objective 2 regions which have experienced some delays in the level of their development, particularly with regard to infrastructure.", "This is the first political point.", "Secondly, the Structural Funds have made and will continue to make a significant contribution to this process of rapprochement.", "All the macroeconomic models on which we are working indicate, for the past decade, that more than one third of the convergence achieved in the undeveloped regions would not have occurred had the Structural Funds not existed.", "However, I have taken good note, with regard in particular to the outermost regions, Mrs Sudre, Mr Fruteau, and also Mr Nogueira Rom\u00e1n, that you say that much remains to be done - and here is my third point - on the plan to improve the content of the recovery of employment, of the fight against social exclusion, of particular gravity and unbearable in many of our regions, of the integration of women and young people into the labour market.", "The fourth political point is the enlargement of the Union: the great political and humanist project of the years to come for our institutions, and also the greatest challenge for cohesion policy in Europe, a point on which Mr Van Dam insisted.", "I would say that in Berlin and in the financial instruments at our disposal, what could be a cohesion policy for the first countries to join us?", "I am thinking in particular of ISPA, for which I will be responsible in the coming weeks.", "You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have just launched our new programming, and we are already discussing together the impact of the enlargement of the Union on our structural policy.", "This sixth periodic report, on which Mr Berend has given a generally positive opinion, is for us, at least for me, a good basis for reflection.", "I would therefore like to thank you very sincerely for this contribution to the reflection that we have begun on the next guidelines, as well as for the proper implementation of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006.", "Thank you very much, Commissioner.", "The debate is closed.", "The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.", "(The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m.)", "Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting", "The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.", "Are there any objections?", "Mr President, I reply to an invitation made yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes.", "I refer to item 11 on the agenda.", "Firstly, I believe that the question raised yesterday by the Chairman of the Socialist Group on the re-establishment of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was important enough for other speakers who wanted to make brief comments on it to accommodate it.", "I would like to express that view, even though I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the Chairman of the Socialist Group.", "The second point I would like to make - and I would have liked to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament, as other speakers noted yesterday, can only have a real impact, if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission.", "We should also have the humility to acknowledge that, if we want to have a strategic debate accompanied not only by a presentation and clarification by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have the corresponding mechanisms more than a week before the debate in this House so that we can discuss and convey our wishes in time to the Commission.", "I would like us to draw a basic education from this.", "When there are important case studies scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future, we must state clearly, and a month earlier, everything we expect from each other in this regard.", "First there must be clarity between all the groups in this House and then between this House and the Commission.", "We must not find ourselves at the end in the unfortunate situation that one institution or another creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relations.", "Having examined some of the press reports last Friday, I believe that the Commission and its President gave evidence of commendable self-control in their public comments.", "That is something I deeply appreciate.", "I hope that we will take advantage of those lessons and not repeat that unnecessary operation, due - I am convinced - to a misunderstanding of what was expected more than in any bad faith by either institution.", "It should not be dramatized and attributed greater importance than it has.", "Thank you very much, Mr Cox.", "I understand the meaning of your speech and we take note of that.", "Mr President, with regard to item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business, yesterday we agreed that the Bourlanges report should be on today's agenda.", "Last night, however, he was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets without having been examined or voted on.", "It must therefore be removed from today's agenda.", "What you point out is clear, Mr Wynn.", "The report was therefore withdrawn from the agenda.", "Mr President, with regard to the comments made yesterday by Mrs Lynne on health and safety in this building, I suppose she was referring to the drains, because on the fifth floor of the tower there is a terrible smell of drains.", "It should be reviewed, because it is a clear indication that something does not work well.", "I do not want to bring up the issue of this building without ceasing, but this is a serious problem.", "We take note of your observation, Mrs Ahern.", "Let me ask you to inform the Quaestors of this particular case, which concerns the fans of a particular plant, since it is indeed a matter of your competence.", "Anyway, we will also inform you of our services.", "Thank you very much.", "(The Minutes were approved)", "Reform of European competition policy", "The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:", "A5-0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernising the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (COM(1999) 101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS));", "A5-0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the XXVIIIth Report of the European Commission on Competition Policy - 1998 (SEC(1999) 743 - C5-121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS));", "A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh report on State aid to industry and other sectors in the European Union (COM(1999) 148-C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS));", "A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission report on the implementation in 1998 of Decision No 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 laying down Community rules on State aid for steel (the Steel Aid Code) (COM(1999) 094 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)).", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we have an important debate on European Union competition policy.", "Its subject is a procedure for modernising European antitrust rules, namely the von Wogau report, which has been much discussed, much more than perhaps the result of the vote in the Committee on Economic Affairs.", "I would like to make it quite clear that I personally consider the Commission's proposal in this particular case to be wrong and that it is not yet clear that it is really justified to use the term modernisation to designate the content of the White Paper on Articles 81 and 82, or whether in this case it would not be more appropriate to speak of a step backwards.", "Today, however, the report on public aid and the general report on competition policy - 1998 are also being discussed, and my intervention in this joint debate concerns the latter.", "Of course, both reports - the competition report and the public aid report - also share a common substantive approach with the White Paper.", "This basic issue is the need for modernisation and the future adequacy of European competition policy.", "The reading of both Commission documents shows that in 1998 the modernization project launched in 1997 was continued and in some respects completed, as we also know from our ongoing parliamentary work.", "Allow me to set out two considerations of principle.", "The Commission, as the competent authority, has always maintained a consistent attitude in the service of free competition, which has not always been welcomed by the Member States or the undertakings concerned.", "The Commission must continue to move along this path.", "However, Commissioner, this will not cease to be complicated in the future; I just want to recall the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union, the deepening of the Single Market, technological progress and globalisation.", "In fact, it is not only important to modernise Community law, but also, more than at any other time, the transparency of decisions in each individual case, the possibility that decisions may also be intelligible, since the success of European competition policy will depend on their acceptance among the population, as well as between the political bodies and companies concerned.", "However, without transparency there will be no acceptance and therefore no modernisation without transparency is possible.", "The 1998 Competition Report is not a bad basis in this respect, but it is all workable.", "In our resolution we put forward a number of proposals to you, Commissioner, but I would now like to highlight one particular point: transparency and accountability are linked.", "It is not my intention to remove the issue of the division of powers between the Commission and Parliament again.", "The Commission is the executive body and Parliament should not seek to set itself up in such a way, in the interests of its own independence, but Parliament is a supervisory body and is there a more appropriate place than the democratically elected Parliament to justify the decisions taken, precisely in the context of a permanent parliamentary debate?", "Here too, we should continue to move along the path that has been initiated, consolidating and intensifying this orientation.", "However, I would also like to stress very clearly that Parliament is the legislative body; it is a real scandal that we are only granted the right of consultation precisely in relation to competition law!", "I therefore call on the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure in the field of competition law.", "As far as the Commission is concerned, I hope that it will exhaust all the possibilities for parliamentary participation, which, in case of doubt, favours the participation of Parliament, already within the framework of the current provisions of the Treaty.", "I also hope that the Commission will actively support our demands for the right of codecision in the legislative procedure.", "This would set a precedent for reasonable cooperation between the two institutions.", "As much as we respect the principle of competition, this is not an objective in itself.", "Competition is an instrument and does not always lead to optimal solutions.", "One of the fundamental economic notions is that the market does not function in a number of respects and whoever denies it is nothing more than an ideologist.", "The aim of competition must be to strike a balance between supply and demand and to ensure an optimal distribution of resources and economic factors.", "Optimum efficiency is not set, however, invariably on its own.", "A framework of conditions to prevent abuse, for example through antitrust laws, is essential.", "But these basically only serve to prevent abuses, not enough alone to achieve socially legitimate goals.", "Competition, yes; limitation of public aid, where possible and necessary.", "However, since public aid occupies the most important part of the 1998 report on competition policy, I would like to add a comment on this, without prejudging Mr Jonckheer's report.", "It is certainly possible and feasible to grant public aid to small and medium-sized enterprises, in the field of research and technological development, for the development of regional policy and in the field of environmental policy.", "State aid for these purposes should be allowed provided that it does not lead to intolerable distortions of competition.", "It is particularly important in this area that decisions are justifiable, more so than in the case of provisions governing cartels and mergers.", "All aid cannot be put at the peak; it must be considered in a differentiated manner and must also be assessed in terms of its contribution to the achievement of the above objectives.", "This last point is addressed above all to the Commission, to colleagues in the PPE Group.", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report that I have the opportunity to present to you today is an opinion on the Commission's annual report on State aid in force within the European Union and on which the Community has competence under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties.", "The Commission's report is essentially descriptive in character, describing the evolution of State aid in the industry sector, as well as in other sectors, according to different typologies, such as the mode of financing and the objectives pursued.", "I would like to refer you to the explanatory memorandum for the quantitative part of the report, and I shall confine myself here to stating that the average annual amount for the period under consideration is in the order of EUR 95 billion, a decrease of approximately 13% over the period 1993-1995, which is basically due to the reduction in aid in the German Federal Republic.", "In short, the declared level of State aid has remained roughly stable on average over the period covered and stands at around 1.2% of Community GDP, i.e. by chance the approximate equivalent of the Community budget for a financial year.", "Having said that, the differences between Member States are considerable and can be measured in different ways, in particular as a percentage of value added and per employee.", "I think it is equally interesting to add State aid and Community assistance which, in a way, can be compared with State aid.", "In doing so, we clearly see that the four countries leading the classification are the same countries that benefit, among others, from the Cohesion Fund.", "I now turn to the proposal contained in the report.", "First of all, we note that the Commission considers that the data, as they are presented in the Commission's annual report, are too aggregated to be able to make a comprehensive assessment of State aid policy, which is both legitimate and sensible in terms of national interests, and very important in terms of competition compliance, even under the provisions of the Treaty.", "The Commission can only collect and analyse the data provided to it by the Member States.", "It is therefore up to the States and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided, and our committee believes that further efforts should be made in this regard.", "In the same spirit, our committee supports the old idea of a public register of state aid which can be accessed, in particular, via the Internet.", "If better, more detailed data are available, in particular with regard to the objectives to be achieved and the results achieved, the European Commission may carry out on its own or commission studies on the socio-economic evaluation of national and regional State aid policies on a regular basis.", "And to the extent that some of these studies already exist, make known in a more open manner your own comments in fulfilment of the objectives of the Treaties, which are not only to ensure the competitiveness of the European economy, but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.", "By insisting, first of all, on the quality of the information provided, our debate in committee and, therefore, the report which I have the honour to present to you, it has avoided the simplicity of a priori stating that the amount of State aid at all is either too high or not sufficiently high.", "A majority of the committee members have continued to seek a balance between, on the one hand, the need to ensure compliance by States, as well as by companies, the rules of competition and, on the other hand, the recognition of the interest of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty, in particular, as I have already said, in the areas of sustainable development, research and development and economic and social cohesion.", "In this connection, various amendments to the rapporteur's initial draft have been adopted in committee, stressing in particular the need for effective reimbursement of aid deemed illegal, as well as the drawing up of a list of results.", "Seven amendments have been reintroduced to this House.", "Most of them effectively reflect the political differences that exist between us regarding the timeliness and effectiveness of State aid, given the inadequacies, whether recognized or not, of the only private investment, market failures or market failures.", "There is one amendment in particular, I stress, concerning the energy sector, which, as rapporteur, seems to me to be particularly important.", "I would like to conclude this presentation, Commissioner, by insisting, on the one hand, on the concern of the members of the committee and, on the other hand, on a requirement of our committee.", "The concern concerns the pre-accession process in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe from the point of view of competition policy and State aid.", "This is certainly a complex issue on which we would like the Commission to make known to us the current state of the dossier, in particular from the point of view of the ability of acceding economies to comply with the competition rules and, with regard to State aid, the likely need to establish specific rules on State aid that favour the restructuring of their sectors.", "Finally, and I conclude with this, the requirement concerns the future powers of the European Parliament in the areas we are dealing with, competition policy and state aid, in the perspective of the Intergovernmental Conference.", "Our report, as you know, Commissioner, defends the idea that the codecision procedure is in place for basic state aid legislation.", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my participation in this debate concerns the Steel Aid Code, that is, public aid granted in Europe in accordance with that Code and controlled by the Commission.", "A total of 27 cases were examined in 1998, on which the Commission has prepared its own report.", "The ECSC Treaty will expire very soon.", "Therefore, the issue that must concern us today is above all that of the future application of aid to the steel industry. The European Parliament welcomes the decisions set out by the Commission in its report, including the decision on the return of aid received in a specific case, pursuant to Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty.", "The Commission's most recent communication, which has not yet been discussed in Parliament, nevertheless also concerns the competitiveness of the European steel industry.", "The general ban on State aid provided for in Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry, as does the other sectors.", "According to that Article, State aid is in principle incompatible with the Common Market.", "Exceptions are allowed only in exactly defined cases.", "In accordance with Article 88, the Commission has an obligation to monitor State aid.", "In 1998, the most important case was the capital injection of EUR 540 million into the company Preussag in Germany.", "The Member States must also notify the Commission in advance of the aid they intend to grant.", "The rules applicable in the steel industry were laid down on 18 December 1996.", "According to them, aid may only be granted to the steel industry in certain precisely defined cases, i.e. aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social aid to encourage the closure of steel plants and aid for the permanent cessation of activity in the case of non-competitive undertakings.", "In addition, there is a derogation for Greece, with a ceiling of EUR 50 million.", "In recent years, however, there have been obvious problems in the practical application of the Steel Aid Code, which are not set out in all its details in the report.", "From Parliament's point of view, it is important that a consecutive regulation is already under discussion by the time the current Steel Aid Code expires.", "The fundamental lines of the Code should not be softened.", "No one wants to open the door to uncontrolled competition based on subsidies in Europe.", "This would seriously affect the functioning of the internal market, even after the consolidation of the steel industry in recent years.", "Parliament therefore considers it necessary to amend the Steel Aid Code with regard to the unequal treatment reported by industry and for the Commission to submit consecutive rules to the Council.", "It is well known that the Council has so far refused to adopt a consecutive regulation.", "This is due, inter alia, to the fact that it is hoped that we will be able to act freely, without the annoying controls of the European Commission, once the Code has expired.", "We therefore demand that, after the expiry of the Treaty, State aid be regulated by a Council regulation, in accordance with Article 94, because only then will it be possible to achieve the necessary legal obligation and clarity.", "The strict prohibition of all aid not covered by the Code can only be imposed in this way.", "A Council regulation is a directly applicable legislative act that must also be complied with by regional governments.", "It is also necessary to avoid in future disruption of competition conditions and serious distortions in the balance of markets.", "The Commission's practice of repeatedly authorising aid to steel undertakings which it considers not to fall within the categories of the Aid Code is also questionable, even if the European Court of Justice has sanctioned this inequality of treatment in certain specific decisions.", "In a report on 1999 which is still being drafted, the Commission is urged to set out in detail its active involvement in drawing up restructuring plans and authorised derogations in order to be able to make an objective assessment of the overall circumstances on this basis.", "Following the unanimous adoption of the report with two abstentions in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I call on the plenary to take forward in all its aspects the proposal we are now presenting.", "Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a new MEP, it is a pleasure for me to be able to speak for the first time in plenary, albeit with a certain delay.", "First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs von Wogau, Langen, Rapkay and Jonckheer, as well as the Commission, for their excellent cooperation.", "Competition is undoubtedly the foundation of the social market economy and European competition policy has a record of success, the most recent in the energy and telecommunications sector, where prices have visibly fallen and service has improved.", "All this for the benefit of the consumer.", "We have now, however, reached a point where competition policy needs to be further developed.", "The Commission has presented a White Paper on this issue, which deals with two central issues: abolition of mandatory notification and transfer of enforcement of the rule.", "The first would unquestionably reduce bureaucracy and administrative expenditure.", "At the same time, with the new system, individual economic actors should obviously also assume greater responsibility.", "They could no longer simply submit a notification and wait for authorization, but each should assume its own responsibility, and perhaps this explains the discomfort that the proposal has generated among some.", "However, I believe that we should take this opportunity to demonstrate that Europe is also able to give a signal in favour of a reduction in bureaucracy.", "The second point is that of the transfer of the implementation of the rule.", "In order to develop a European legal culture, it is certainly necessary that the application of the rules does not fall exclusively to the Commission, to the central bodies, but also to the national authorities and courts.", "There is no question of the requirement that all EU legislation be decided exclusively from the central bodies.", "However, it is precisely during the adaptation phase that there will be some legal uncertainty and, in this context, it certainly seems necessary that an instrument should be developed within the framework of the envisaged legislative procedure to provide legal certainty for companies and allow them to appeal to the Commission.", "The doors should be kept open for the creation of a European Competition Bureau, which will certainly be discussed in the future.", "Competition policy must, however, be more transparent.", "We need greater involvement of Parliament and the creation of a register to verify the degree of state compliance could also contribute to improving discipline between Member States, in my opinion.", "There are, however, two areas of particular concern to me in relation to the future of competition.", "The first is the issue of subsidiarity.", "We all agree that competition is necessary for the economy and that it contributes to promoting performance, and in this regard I believe that we should also allow competition between regions.", "It would not weaken the European Union, but would certainly help to strengthen it.", "Examples include agricultural aid, the example of savings banks and banks in the L\u00e4nder, and the quality label.", "Cases in which a region has contributed its own efforts to the marketing of its products.", "We cannot allow this capacity for autonomous initiative to be destroyed at European level.", "In my view, it is also necessary to delete the de minimis rule.", "We would have to do everything in our power to force competition between the regions.", "The second aspect is the need for a debate on competition and the social market economy, and I am not talking now about a market failure.", "I have already mentioned the local banks and savings banks sector, but now I would like to put in the foreground what is constantly repeated from different sectors.", "Currently, the person living in a nursing home is considered to be included in the social sector.", "However, it would also be possible to regard it as a customer, and I believe that we should debate very clearly and without delay on what aspects of the social sector and the structures that have been created are a brake on competition.", "Otherwise, it is possible for any sector, any sector, to be designated as customers and for the social sectors to be dismantled.", "Before concluding, a final consideration of the principle of subsidiarity: in my opinion it is urgently necessary that the competence of regions and municipalities be maintained to collect taxes in cases where Member States allow it, and that it be not uniformly regulated from Europe.", "Thank you very much, Your Honor.", "Allow me to congratulate you on what German parliamentarism designates - unjustly in your case - as the \"premi\u00e8re speech\" (Jungfernrede).", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Robert Goebbels, who has had to be absent to attend to a political compromise.", "Within the Economic and Monetary Commission, the Jonckheer report has raised harsh disputes over the functioning of the market.", "A small right-wing majority has managed to eliminate any reference to market failures.", "Even if Parliament were largely pursuing this ultra-liberal concept of a supposedly perfect market, the world would not change for that reason.", "Economic relations in the real world show that the elimination of all public intervention in the market does not in any way produce perfect competition or an optimal distribution of resources.", "Although the market has been since the night of time the privileged place of exchange of human beings, it has never been perfect.", "The market gives priority to the short term and to immediate profits.", "In the market, strong relations between supply and demand are generally at the disadvantage of the weakest, consumers and workers.", "The market needs rules to function.", "The necessary and precious spirit of initiative must have as corollary the sense of responsibilities to society.", "We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy for social purposes.", "The market is not an end in itself; it must serve the improvement of the human condition.", "The European Union, the states, should not replace economic actors, but the public authorities should define the rules and objectives for sustainable development of the economy.", "Finally, the aid makes it possible to restructure, offer training, save jobs and, ultimately, act with good courage.", "The Union's competition policy cannot have as its main objective a reduction in the overall level of aid.", "It is necessary to direct these aid towards the objectives of the Union, in particular economic and social cohesion, sustainable development and research.", "The Commission must pursue illegal aid and aid that actually cuts the internal market.", "Abolishing any public aid would be a serious mistake.", "The Internet is not a product of the market, but the result of research financed by the American army.", "The World Wide Web, which has made possible the brilliant development of the information society, was once again financed by CERN in Geneva with public aid.", "The rescue of the Holzmann group by the German Government has been criticized as an unjustifiable cutback to the market economy.", "President Duisenberg has even tried to attribute the relative weakness of the euro against the dollar to this state interventionism.", "I have not heard Mr Duisenberg criticise the rescue of the Hedge Fund LTCM by the US monetary authorities.", "Wanting to save 60,000 jobs is, apparently, a sin against the market, but the rescue of capital does not seem to pose any problem to the advocates of the free market.", "Public funds are mobilized to repair the damage of international speculation, as has happened in Mexico, Asia and Brazil.", "On the other hand, people's work is considered a simple adjustment factor.", "We Socialists oppose this liberal abstraction.", "We want a genuine competition culture in Europe.", "The hand of States must remain visible in order to set the stage for the market and the Commission should act as an arbitrator.", "Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for his good report and good cooperation.", "I would like to thank you, Commissioner Monti, for your excellent cooperation and to say that at this turn of the century you have a particularly important role to play.", "It must sweep away the traces left by national governments that have great visions of competition policy, but only imagination sets limits to the catastrophes that national governments can cause.", "At this point I can mention the last examples of which we have witnessed: Holzmann, a company which receives considerable aid from the German government, sawmills in former East Germany and especially aid to shipyards.", "There are three areas in which many Danish companies are facing serious problems and are being pushed out of their markets.", "I would like to tell Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these cases illustrate how some of the European Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and thus contribute to undermining the value of the euro.", "The Liberal Group has tabled 80 amendments in the committee, all relating to state aid.", "These are proposals that we think contribute to providing transparency and clarity, which are very important qualities in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.", "I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues in committee for their support of the Liberal Group's amendments.", "Our proposals, as I said, relate to transparency and I would like to highlight the amendment that calls on the Commission to present uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aid that we consider legal, precisely to ensure that companies can predict their situation.", "Another point is the question of what to do when state aid is declared illegal.", "How do we ensure that state aid declared illegal is returned to us?", "There is no common rule in this area today, and we strongly urge the Commission to work towards harmonizing the rules on return.", "This is the way forward to ensure homogeneous conditions for competition.", "Finally, we propose that a register be drawn up on the one hand, as several of my colleagues have mentioned, and on the other hand a table of results showing the situation of countries with regard to state aid.", "You have shown us the way, Mr Monti, with the results table for the internal market.", "This is the source of inspiration for our proposal for a similar table for state aid.", "I hope and trust that you, Commissioner Monti, will support these proposals and I await your comments and your position on them.", "In conclusion, I would like to welcome the report on the competence of DG XXVIII of the Commission, to which a considerable amount of work has once again been devoted.", "However, as I have already mentioned, our ultimate purpose must remain transparency and clarity.", "There is still a need to improve efficiency in the above-mentioned areas, and there is therefore sufficient reason to continue working with a view to resolving the problems related to the lack of transparency and clarity in the field of State aid.", "Above all, it is necessary with regard to the forthcoming enlargement, and I would like to thank Mr Jonckheer, who has dealt very thoroughly in his report with all the problems related to enlargement and with how to ensure that these countries meet our requirements and also that we compete on an equal footing.", "It is clear that as liberals and greens we have different views of the world, yet in our objectives we are largely in agreement and will try to find a reasonable solution to our problems.", "Mr President, Commissioner, we simply have to answer two questions.", "Are state aid to enterprises legitimate or are agreements between companies in a market economy legitimate, and who should control these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy?", "With regard to the first point, we openly state that, in order to take account of the needs of sustainable development which the European Union subscribes to, it is essential that in certain cases state aid be provided to enterprises, whether in the form of tax relief, a differentiated tax system or simply direct aid.", "It is also legitimate that agreements exist between companies, self-limitation agreements, all of these agreements that allow to mitigate the harmful effects of competition on social needs or ecological needs.", "We therefore answer quite clearly yes: it is legitimate that there should be aid, that there should be agreements, but we affirm that each of these agreements should be expressly subject to argumentation.", "The von Wogau report proposes to restore control of this legitimacy at national level.", "That seems relatively dangerous to us, but we will nevertheless give you our vote in favour, because we recognize that the Commission cannot do everything.", "We demand that greater transparency be applied and that the Commission be given greater investigative power to verify ex post facto the legitimacy of these exceptions.", "Mr President, once again we are debating the European Union's competition policy.", "Under what conditions, however, does this debate really take place and what conclusions should we draw?", "What characterizes today's reality is the materialization of gigantic takeovers, mergers and purchases of unusual monopolistic companies and the formation of tremendously powerful groups of planetary scope.", "Frankly, shouldn't our discussion of this situation be taken up?", "What competition policy does he want and can he put in place controls on the actions of these monopoly companies?", "Certain sectors of European industry, such as shipbuilding, air transport and the steel industry, which are affected by the competition policy applied, have suffered terrible consequences.", "They have lost important parts of the world market and hundreds of thousands of jobs.", "Are we ever going to deal with this reality?", "The scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance puts the economy of entire countries, including member countries of the Union, in the hands of speculative multinational groups.", "Despite all this, we insist on further weakening the public sector and are ready to further tighten competition policy by considering state aid, including public administration orders or orders to public enterprises.", "On the other hand, the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs leads to an explosive increase in unemployment.", "Workers face the greatest aggression against their labour and social rights.", "Consumers are witnessing a decline in their standard of living, the spread of poverty and the dismantling and dissolution of the public sector and the productive base of most of the countries of the Union, in the name of violent and devastating competition, in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopoly interests of big capital.", "We also consider all this to be responsible for the competition policy that is being pursued, and we express our complete rejection of that policy.", "Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of this hinge year, before moving to the single currency, the Commission has spared no effort to ensure that the euro is born in a favourable environment.", "Competition policy has contributed, within these means, to this event.", "For our part, we remain firmly opposed to the single currency which, far from bringing us advantages and the flexibility of a common currency, binds us to the artificial yoke imposed on the peoples of Europe.", "Having said that, to govern is to foresee, is also to be responsible and in this new imposed context, competition law must naturally play a fundamental role.", "In this area, the Commission has given priority to several areas of action: to act on the structure of markets through the active pursuit of anti-corruption practices, to direct the control activity of its services only towards matters of manifest Community interest and to mark its willingness to modernise competition law.", "As far as State aid is concerned, we must ensure that the system is not overburdened, and the introduction of a public register, in which all aid is allocated, does not seem desirable to us, because this heavy obligation would run counter to attempts to ease bureaucratic obstacles.", "Finally, as regards the modernisation of the application of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not think that decentralised application is necessarily the right path.", "In fact, the Commission not only retains the power to remove a matter from the competence of national authorities, but also imposes a clear obligation on national jurisdictions to avoid any conflict with Commission decisions.", "National States would thus become the secular arm of the Commission for the enforcement of rules beyond its jurisdiction.", "In conclusion, I would say that although certain measures are well-targeted, we will remain vigilant in order to avoid a federalist gear that would be detrimental to Europe and to the sovereignty of States.", "Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are basically positive about the Commission's White Paper on competition, particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notifications and authorisations, but we also have some perplexity, or rather more than one.", "First of all, there is the risk that the decentralization of competences, which is in many ways necessary within the various States, will lead to an abnormal development of competition initiatives, as well as that someone will be tempted to use antitrust not as a ultimate guarantee of the good and predictable functioning of markets, but as an instrument of economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the normal dynamics of the same markets or even as an instrument of protectionist policies.", "In this respect, I believe that the writings of von Eieck and, without a doubt, those of a great Italian liberal, Bruno Leoni, who warned us of the risks of an abnormal development of anti-competitive policies will help us.", "Today, State interference in the economy causes the most serious damage to the market, to competition and to the freedom of choice of European users and consumers.", "There are state aid to companies, we have already talked about them, there is still a strong public presence in the economy - think of which the Italian Treasury controls 15% of the stock market capitalization - there are the obstacles that governments and central banks place on merger and acquisition operations; during these weeks there has been frequent talk of the Vodafone-Mannesmann case and the rescue of Holzmann.", "Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sectors of the economy, such as public television, are still in public hands, funded by taxpayers, communications offices and some compulsory insurance systems, including health care and foresight, managed by ineffective public monopolies that leave users, except the most able, no escape.", "Commissioner, I am well aware of the links between the Treaties, but I believe that it is also important on this occasion to reiterate that the European economy suffers in competition with the American economy, also and above all because of the lack of openness and competition.", "What is being done is probably very important but still insufficient.", "Mr President, we have a particular debate: on competition policy and state aid, the left and right hand of the administration, so to speak.", "While EMU criteria require Member States to reduce their expenditure, the high level of State aid to private enterprise remains.", "It is understandable that the Member State starting to reduce State aid runs the risk of companies leaving, with the corresponding negative consequences for employment.", "But at the same time it is incomprehensible, because bad corporate sense and unfeasible jobs should not be supported with taxpayers' money.", "In principle, horizontal regulations can only be accepted, because they hardly alter, or do not alter, competition at all.", "That is why Amendments Nos 6 and 7 by the rapporteur deserve our support.", "Amendments 1 and 5 point to the phenomenon of market failure, since market instruments alone do not lead us to the ideal society.", "The underprivileged are right where the sticks fall.", "The functioning of the market must be taken advantage of in a calculated way so that the responsibility of citizens and businesses can be fully developed.", "If this bet fails, the administration must intervene.", "The Commission White Paper on modernising competition policy is more like a discussion paper.", "The defence of decentralisation to ease job saturation in the Competition DG sounds nice, but the way in which the Commission wants to do it will overburden the judiciary.", "And this would undermine the legal certainty of private companies.", "Will the Commission's overwork actually be reduced if national judges are obliged to report to the Commission?", "What is the Council's view of this and is the Commissioner prepared to reconsider these issues deeply?", "Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not made to take or leave, its function is to provoke answers and this White Paper has succeeded.", "It is a good basis for discussion and we welcome you in that regard.", "I understand the authors' starting points and share them.", "I also hope that you, Commissioner, will want to maintain the reputation and work done by your predecessors and that your services will have the same objective.", "I cannot imagine that the Commission will develop initiatives to deseuropeise or renationalise drastically, but I am concerned and have some questions.", "First of all, I have a question about the consistency of policy implementation.", "As a general rule I am a great supporter of cultural diversity, but not in the field of competition in the internal market.", "The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept but also in terms of implementation.", "It is true that European regulations and interpretative communications are drawn up.", "The Commission would have the right of knowledge and give guidelines to national competition authorities.", "However, I wonder if we do not run the risk of getting into a procession in Echternach where before we can take two steps forward we must each take one back.", "Therefore, Commissioner, I would like to know a little more about how the Commission will ensure this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself see the paths outlined from point 100 of the White Paper as feasible.", "Secondly, I understand the concerns of private enterprise about legal certainty.", "Just for that reason there are so many notifications.", "This instrument will disappear in the future.", "You say in the White Paper that the Commission will continue to grant unique authorisations which can serve as a guideline, but what criteria will be used to grant such unique authorisations or not?", "Thirdly, I would like to know whether the Commission has investigated the consequences of its new policy on business strategy.", "I am particularly concerned about the fate of SMEs who will lose part of the legal and economic protection under the new vertical block exemption in the distribution sector.", "Fourthly, I would like to know why the Commission does not choose in the event of obvious infringements of the competition rules to allow the penalty of invalidity ex tunc to come into operation.", "Fifthly, there is the imminent enlargement and I wonder if the candidate countries are prepared for our game.", "It's like they're still training.", "What guarantees do we have that will evolve to top players in the internal market league?", "Sixthly and lastly, I point out an issue that I have already recalled in my report on vertical restraints, that is to say the \"legal privilege\" of business lawyers.", "If the Commission makes its White Paper proposals, it seems to me that discrimination in the internal market between external and internal legal advisers will increase and will therefore become more unacceptable.", "Does the Commission have to take any action to grant \"legal privilege\" to inhouse lawyers in all Member States?", "Commissioner, I ask you these questions as an advocate of the internal market and I hope that we will be partners in this respect and that the discussion between these partners will not be carried out in vain but will bear fruit.", "Mr President, I would like my first words, as I begin my speech on the White Paper, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau.", "The high degree of agreement between the Group of the Party of European Socialists and its report is clear evidence that a single amendment has been tabled at this stage.", "We therefore agree with the report in the same way, Commissioner, that we agree with the fundamental lines of the White Paper.", "Since the entry into force of the Treaty, Community competition law has been one of the basic parts of Community policy.", "However, after nearly forty years of validity, these rules have begun to give rise to symptoms of exhaustion.", "It was therefore urgent to modernize.", "Such modernization was particularly necessary in five points.", "Firstly, the system of authorisations; secondly, decentralised application; thirdly, rules of procedure; fourthly, judicial enforcement; and fifthly and lastly, excessive formalism.", "The system of unique authorizations required urgent reform, which was unanimously requested by companies, scholars and specialized lawyers.", "I have not attended a single forum of competition law specialists in which no change in the system was requested.", "A system capable of offering so few decisions, whether of authorization or prohibition, as the one in force, is anything but a valid system.", "Articles 81(1) and 82 could, for a long time, be applied by national competition authorities.", "However, they could not apply article 81.3, which to some extent prevented a consistent application of article 81.1.", "At present, your honors know that two questions for a preliminary ruling are pending before the Court of Justice, raised by two German courts, in which it is questioned whether it is possible to apply Article 81(1) without being able to apply Article 81.3.", "Reform was therefore also necessary at that point.", "The competition procedure is basically contained in Regulation No 1762.", "The voices in favour of its modification were unanimous.", "The failure to establish a genuine procedure, to set time limits, to regulate the access of the interested parties to the file or to give adequate recognition to the rights of the defence were grounds for unanimity in the request for reform.", "The Court of Justice has long accepted that Community competition law could be applied by the courts of the Member States, and the Commission published a communication on this subject in 1994.", "It was therefore necessary to facilitate that path.", "One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive formalism.", "As a result of the continental legal tradition, the consideration of whether certain agreements are anticompetitive depends more on the analysis of their clauses than on the effects on the market.", "It was therefore necessary to introduce economic analysis.", "The White Paper seeks to solve these problems and we therefore support its proposals.", "It is true that we also note certain shortcomings that have been highlighted in the report.", "Among them, first of all, which, despite trying to modernise articles 81 and 82, places exclusively the weight on article 81 and not on article 82.", "At this time, when the processes of concertation of companies, or privatization of monopolies, have held dominant positions and even increased them, the persecution of abusive behaviour becomes particularly important.", "Secondly, Regulation No 1762 should be repealed and replaced by a new regulation.", "In those terms, we will support the report.", "However, if some of the amendments were adopted, particularly those tabled by the PPE Group, we would consider that the report would be distorted, would become a contradictory document, lacking in rigour and, in that case, we would reconsider our support.", "Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, among the various issues covered in this joint debate, I would like to make a reflection on what our colleague Berenguer has dealt with, namely the modernisation of competition policy, to which the Commission's White Paper refers.", "Frankly, I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory.", "Commissioner Monti has achieved good results in his management, like his predecessor and has obviously established the guarantee that, in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market, he has been able to establish the corresponding corrective measures to ensure that the market economy within the Union functions properly, without the deviations that economists know can exist when the market is expanded, as has happened in the European Union since 1993.", "If it works well, if we are satisfied, if the Commission's basic action has been correct, why the modification?", "Various arguments have been put forward in his favour.", "Mr Berenguer has offered a very close analysis, justifying its need and the consequent reforms to improve the functioning of competition, but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria to be applied through the relevant administrations of the Member States are indeed everywhere identical.", "Because if not, we will be faced with the paradox that it is the Commission itself that introduces elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market.", "In that case we would not have made progress but, on the contrary, we would have fallen back on the application of competition policy within the Union.", "Mr President, I would like to place on record first of all my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union, over previous editions.", "I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, who has succinctly dissected such a dense and comprehensive text as this.", "And I would also like to fully support him in his comment on the need to leave regions - such as the Basque Country, which I represent - a margin of action under the principle of subsidiarity.", "However, I cannot forget the criticisms made on numerous occasions by both the Member States and market operators, who, in view of the wide scope for manoeuvre, discretion, recognised to the Commission to assess each individual case, argue that there is legal uncertainty, in the absence of clear rules of the game that allow the interested parties to foresee the position of the authority and, thus, to make their requests for aid for the promotion of economic activity and employment, the approach of mergers of undertakings, etc.", "The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable authorization, using individual files that are not resolved within six or eight months, an excessively long period of time that only adds problems of lack of agility to the activity generating wealth and employment.", "That is why I am failing and, consequently, I suggest the desirability of establishing more regulations, of promulgating clear rules of the game, with which we can win all: employers, investors, workers and citizens in general.", "Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to stress that, at a time of great technological change - just see what is happening in the information sector or in other sectors such as energy and transport - the protection of competition will be of fundamental importance for our future.", "I believe that, from the point of view of economic growth and, therefore, of increasing employment and wealth, defending a competition policy in our States becomes a determining factor and undoubtedly fundamental to our future.", "This is why I am basically positive about this report.", "I have noticed that, in recent times, the Commission has endeavoured to ensure that this principle is respected in a specific and forceful manner, in order to safeguard that flexibility of markets for both products and services.", "I repeat that this will be very important for our future, for Europe's economy and, above all, to protect our wealth and the technological development of Europe in general.", "Mr President, for British Conservatives, the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is essential for achieving an effective single market throughout the European Union.", "It follows from this that any proposal for a major reform of the competition policy enforcement mechanism needs to be examined in detail and in detail.", "The truth is that the single market is not yet complete.", "During the six months I have been a Member of this Parliament, I have clearly seen the determination of many Members to move forward with the so-called European project.", "Every day we hear about the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe.", "But all that is, in fact, pure and simple rhetoric, when we see the national, regional and local obstacles that continue to block the functioning of a genuine European single market.", "That is the framework within which I want to examine the Commission's proposals.", "I would like to say quite clearly that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti.", "We consider him the right person to eradicate cartels.", "But it must be acknowledged that, as in other cases, we have to examine these proposals of yours and submit them to a rigorous examination.", "That is what our rapporteur has done in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr von Wogau.", "I would like to congratulate him, although he is unfortunately not present, for the thorough and rigorous manner in which he has embarked on the preparation of his report \u2014 and also for having endured me as a thorn in his side!", "He said earlier that the report had been adopted with an important majority, but not with my support.", "So, although I may not share your conclusions, I believe you have illustrated in your report many of the issues that the Commission must address.", "The first is the possibility of renationalisation of competition policy.", "I know that the Commission is opposed to this, but these possibilities exist."]}}; }
